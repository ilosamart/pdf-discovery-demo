be prepositioned in a given jurisdiction.7  Specifically, the FSB contemplates that internal TLAC 

requirements of a subsidiary of a foreign bank expected to be resolved through SPOE would be 

calibrated at 75 to 90 percent of the external TLAC requirement that would apply to the 

subsidiary if it were to be separately resolved.  In implementing the TLAC standards in the 

United States, the Board calibrated the internal TLAC requirement for IHCs of foreign-owned  

G-SIBs at the high end of the FSB range, at around 90 percent.  

Adjustments to the Current Regime 

 There are two principal points I have been making today.  The first is that some amount 

of local capital and liquidity prepositioning can reduce the incentives for damaging and 

unpredictable seizures of resources by local regulators during times of stress--thus actually 

reducing the likelihood that improvised, beggar-thy-neighbor ring-fencing would frustrate 

completion of a successful SPOE resolution in the future.  As we learned long ago out West, the 

branding of cattle creates the possibility of trust.   

The second point, however, is equally important: the best prepositioning structure is not 

an eternal verity mathematically deducible from first principles, but it is instead a practical 

balance designed to promote cooperation among humans, and any such balance is likely to be 

improvable with experience, reflection, and debate.  We are interested in views from the firms 

and the public on how the regimes can be improved, and we expect to invite public comment on 

our living will guidance for U.S. and foreign firms in the near future.  In addition, we are 

currently weighing the costs and benefits of our current approach of directing firms to determine
