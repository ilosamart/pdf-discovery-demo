Saving is Important 

As you develop a financial plan, I offer my second recommendation:  Saving is 

important, and you’re going to need to increase your savings to manage your financial lives 

successfully.  American families rely on savings and investments to achieve a secure retirement, 

save for their children’s education, buy homes, start businesses, manage financial emergencies, 

and pass on wealth and opportunities to the next generation.  This not only makes financial 

sense, but there’s a growing body of evidence that families with savings and assets generally do 

better in life than those without in terms of social, behavioral, educational, and economic 

outcomes.   

I am aware that during tough economic times, saving is a challenge for people at all 

stages of life.  Starting salaries for recent college graduates have declined, which means that 

young Americans who are employed have fewer resources for saving and investing than previous 

generations.  On the other end of the spectrum, many older workers are delaying retirement 

because they have insufficient assets to fund their retirement.  Even more troubling is research 

showing that many consumers who should be saving for retirement have been forced to take 

hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) plans.  According to an analysis by Vanguard, hardship 

withdrawals increased by 49 percent between 2005 and 2010.6   

The increasing use of retirement savings for other purposes is particularly problematic 

now that employers have increasingly shifted the responsibility for saving for retirement toward 

individual employees.  Having a secure retirement is a high priority and a significant long-term
