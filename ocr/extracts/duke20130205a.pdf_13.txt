serious delinquencies on such loans made to prime borrowers, indicating that community banks 

largely have managed their existing portfolios responsibly.  On the other hand, residential 

mortgage loans made by community banks do frequently share some characteristics, such as 

higher rates and balloon payments, with the subprime lending that proved to be so disastrous.  At 

the same time, mortgage lending, which averages about one-fourth of community bank loan 

portfolios, is an important product line for community banks.  Further, Federal Reserve research 

indicates that the residential mortgage loans made by community banks make up a small but vital 

part of credit availability in the housing market. 

The challenge for regulators is to design mortgage regulations to address practices that 

have proved harmful to consumers or financial stability without inhibiting lending to 

creditworthy borrowers.  The challenge for community bankers is to review the full body of new 

regulations covering mortgage lending and to develop the expertise and control systems 

necessary to comply with these regulations while remaining active in this important market.   

I think it is unfortunate when I hear some bankers say that they will stop offering 

mortgages if they can’t make them the same way that they always have.  While I certainly 

understand their frustration, I still believe that community bankers can respond within the new 

environment by creating products that are profitable and meet the needs of their customers, while 

still managing their interest rate and funding risks.  

Even with some regulatory exceptions, compliance with new mortgage regulations likely 

will require changes to processing systems and extensive staff training.  But it is also possible 

that the systems and expertise necessary to make qualified mortgages for the bank’s books could 

also be used to originate loans for sale.  For many community banks, this could represent a new 

revenue opportunity and a new alternative to offer the bank’s customers.
