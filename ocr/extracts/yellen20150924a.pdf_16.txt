expectations for long-run inflation.  This measure is now noticeably lower than in the 

years just prior to the financial crisis.25  However, movements in inflation compensation 

are difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial 

markets--such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums--as well as by changes in 

expected inflation.26  Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors 

suggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact 

moved down relatively little over the past decade.27  Nevertheless, the decline in inflation 

compensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see 

an increased risk of very low inflation persisting.  

Although the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well 

anchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.  

Anchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly:  Experience suggests 

that it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households 

and firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent 

failure to keep inflation under control--by letting it drift either too high or too low for too 

                                                 
25 In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep 
in mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI.  CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point 
higher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.  
26 Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.  
Inflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic 
Indicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation 
expectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but 
need not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly.  As an empirical matter, the little 
information available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve 
Business Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble 
expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional 
forecasters.  Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms 
are much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and 
Gorodnichenko, 2015). 
27 D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected 
inflation estimates.  The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations 
since 2005.
