Conclusion 

The discrepancy between slow growth in income and wealth, on the one hand, 

and rising costs of housing, health care, and education, on the other, may be making it 

more difficult for middle-income families to achieve middle-class financial security.  

Long-term, the shifting of wealth and income to the top of the distribution and away from 

the middle could pose challenges to the health and resilience of our economy.  These are 

important questions, and I am pleased that this conference is bringing to light interesting 

research to shed light on them.
