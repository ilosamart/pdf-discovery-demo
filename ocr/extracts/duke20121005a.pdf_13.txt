As encouraging as these new self-financing features are, land banks and municipalities 

are still struggling with the high costs of demolition.  For example, in Cuyahoga County, home 

to Cleveland, Ohio, about 80 percent of the approximately 100 properties per month that the land 

bank acquires need demolition, but at $10,000 in average costs per demolition, the Cuyahoga 

Land Bank is struggling to find the resources to fund this activity.21  The state of Ohio recently 

dedicated $75 million of its direct payments from the Attorneys’ General (AG) National 

Mortgage Settlement to fund a new grant program for demolition of abandoned and vacant 

properties statewide.22  This $75 million still will not solve all of Ohio’s demolition needs, but 

leveraging public and private funds like the AG settlement or developing new national sources of 

bond financing could help address this local problem.23   

“Traditional Suburban” Locations 

The last category of high-vacancy areas in the typology that I discussed earlier is 

“traditional suburban” neighborhoods.  In contrast to the other two types of high-vacancy census 

tracts, these neighborhoods are more evenly spread across many metropolitan areas, illustrating 

that vacancy can be a problem in any community.  Furthermore, ZIP codes in the “traditional 

suburban” tracts do not tend to have a higher share of property vacancies resulting from 

foreclosure than other ZIP codes, which demonstrates that some neighborhoods are struggling 

with long-term vacancy issues even though they did not experience large numbers of 

foreclosures.  While the vacancies faced by these suburban areas might not have been caused by 

foreclosure problems, the costs to neighborhoods are every bit as real.  Such areas represent

LaTourette (R-OH) would authorize creation of “Qualified Urban Demolition Bonds” to support demolition costs.
