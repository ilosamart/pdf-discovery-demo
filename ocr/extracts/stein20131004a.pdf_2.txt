Thank you.  It’s a pleasure to be here at this workshop.  In an effort to provide 

some broad framing for the sessions to follow, I thought I would try to do three things in 

my opening remarks.1  First, I will briefly discuss the welfare economics of fire sales.  

That is, I will try to make clear when a forced sale of an asset is not just an event that 

leads to prices being driven below long-run fundamental values, but also one that 

involves a market failure, or externality, of the sort that might justify a regulatory 

response.  Second, I will argue that securities financing transactions (SFTs) are a leading 

example of the kind of arrangement that can give rise to such externalities, and hence are 

particularly deserving of policy attention.  And third, I will survey some of the recently 

enhanced tools in our regulatory arsenal (e.g., capital, liquidity, and leverage 

requirements) and ask to what extent they are suited to tackling the specific externalities 

associated with fire sales and SFTs.   

To preview, a general theme is that while many of these tools are likely to be 

helpful in fortifying individual regulated institutions—in reducing the probability that, 

say, a given bank or broker-dealer will run into solvency or liquidity problems—they fall 

short as a comprehensive, marketwide approach to the fire-sales problem associated with 

SFTs.  In this regard, some of what I have to say will echo a recent speech by my Board 

colleague Daniel Tarullo.2
