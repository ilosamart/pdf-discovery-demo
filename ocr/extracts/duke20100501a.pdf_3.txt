speaks, she speaks for you.  Her knowledge of the issues facing consumers in today’s economy 

has been a valuable resource for us at the Fed.   

Now, I have long been an advocate for better financial education, but I must admit that I 

am especially pleased that this program is aimed specifically at women.  As a professional 

woman with a long career in banking, I have known many savvy and astute businesswomen who 

have demonstrated what good financial managers women can be.  I have also seen wealthy, well-

educated women freeze when suddenly confronted with a financial decision for which they had 

no decisionmaking framework.  And I have seen single mothers with limited education manage a 

household budget with a precision that would make most chief financial officers envious.  My 

point is that the need for financial education crosses all educational and socioeconomic 

boundaries.   

I firmly believe that, first, all women need financial education and,second, that once 

armed with that education, all women are capable of making good, sound financial decisions that 

will improve their own financial well-being and that of their families.  Over the years, I have 

observed that, whether leaving home for the first time, starting a new career, seeking higher 

education, taking time to raise a family, retiring, or facing life alone after a spouse dies, women 

consistently approach uncertainty with practical planning skills.  But oftentimes, they need help 

finding the information and advice they need to make sound decisions.  Your ongoing 

participation in the Financially Hers program today reflects your commitment to planning for a 

sound financial future.  And I congratulate each of you for your dedication and your 

accomplishment.
