providing more time to both firms and supervisors to run the stress tests.  Incidentally, because 

these reports will be filed quarterly, our supervisors will be able to monitor more effectively how 

firms are performing relative to their projected baselines.  This, in turn, will enable us to require 

resubmissions of capital plans in a more timely way, should conditions change materially at an 

individual firm or more broadly in the industry. 

One issue that we will be considering at some length is the nature of communications 

between supervisors and firms during the duration of the stress test and CCAR.  Some of the 

practical concerns about communication can be fairly easily addressed, such as by continuing to 

improve the timeliness of answering technical questions and generally having more coordinated 

communication with the firms throughout the process.   

Other concerns will require more extensive thought.  I think it fair to say, for example, 

that many firms were frustrated by the limitations on how much supervisors would communicate 

about modeling assumptions and other information relevant to capital planning decisions.  Here, 

there is some tension between the desirability of providing more information to firms and the 

importance of not turning capital planning into a mechanical compliance exercise, in which firms 

simply run the Federal Reserve model, instead of developing and enhancing their own risk-

management and capital planning capacities.  We do not want to encourage a world in which 

everyone simply applies the same risk-management model, rather than engages in the important 

and multidimensional process of evaluating and modeling risk.  But there should be ways to 

provide some further explanation of our modeling approach without leading to this outcome, 

particularly in the aftermath -- rather than in the middle -- of the supervisory exercise itself. 

As a first step along these lines, we hope the symposium and other channels for 

discussing good modeling practices will reduce the “black box” feeling of some of the firms.  Of
