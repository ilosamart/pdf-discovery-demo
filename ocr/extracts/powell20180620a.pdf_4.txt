A historical comparison 

Because we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is 

interesting to compare today’s labor market with that earlier period.  Unemployment was 

below 4 percent from February 1966 through January 1970.  During that time, inflation as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from 

below 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970.  In hindsight, unemployment is now 

widely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to 

escalating inflation.   

But how significant is this precedent for today?  The U.S. economy has changed 

in many ways over the past 50 years.  By some estimates, the natural rate of 

unemployment is substantially lower now.4  For example, the Congressional Budget 

Office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5-3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 

1960s, compared with 4-3/4 percent at present.5   

Rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, 

because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed.  The share of the 

population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to 

nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined 

                                                 
4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate over the longer term that is consistent with 
low and stable inflation.  It comprises both the “frictional” unemployment of people who are temporarily 
between jobs or searching as they have reentered the labor force and the more “structural” unemployment 
of people whose skills or physical location are not a good match for the jobs available.  For more 
discussion, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them,” speech 
delivered at the Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, January 18,

5 Contemporaneous estimates of the natural rate (or “full employment”) from the late 1960s were lower 
than current estimates for that period.  For example, the Economic Report of the President from 1968 
defined potential output as occurring when the unemployment rate is 4 percent.  See Executive Office of 
the President of the United States (1968), Economic Report of the President (Washington:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office, February), p. 61, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/1968.pdf.
