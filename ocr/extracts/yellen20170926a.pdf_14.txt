down overall inflation for several years.  If these sorts of favorable supply-type shocks 

continue, achieving our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a 

more accommodative stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate.  

Some commentators have conjectured that, because of rising trade volumes and 

the integration of production chains across countries, U.S. inflation now depends on 

global resource utilization, not just on conditions here at home and those effects arising 

through movements in energy and import prices.  However, studies of this issue do not, 

on balance, provide much empirical support for this possibility.23  Moreover, foreign 

economic growth has firmed this year and the global economy appears to have largely 

recovered, so any influence that global resource utilization might have on U.S. inflation 

would presumably be small.  Nevertheless, increased competition from the integration of 

China and other emerging market countries into the world economy may have materially 

restrained price margins and labor compensation in the United States and other advanced 

economies.  In fact, one study concludes that most of the decline in the labor share of 

national income in the United States since the late 1980s can be attributed to offshoring 

of labor-intensive production.24  If this restraint on the labor share continues to build over 

                                                 
23 In an early study, Borio and Filardo (2007) reported results suggesting that global economic slack adds 
considerable explanatory power to reduced-form inflation equations (such as the one discussed in the 
appendix), and that its role has been growing over time.  However, Ihrig, Kamin, Lindner, and Marquez 
(2010) subsequently argued that the estimated link was not robust to alternative measures of global 
resource utilization.  Federal Reserve Board staff have updated this analysis using data through early 2017 
and confirmed that global slack does not appear to exert an appreciable direct effect on domestic inflation 
in the United States and most other advanced economies. 
24 Using sector-level data, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) estimate the contributions of offshoring, the 
substitution of capital for low-skilled labor, and several other factors on the aggregate U.S. labor share of 
income, and find that only offshoring has been important.  They also conclude that the decline in the labor 
share since the late 1980s has been overstated as a result of statistical measurement problems.  In contrast 
to the influence of globalization on the U.S. labor share, Feenstra and Weinstein (2017) find that the 
influence of increased globalization on price markups in the United States has been modest.
