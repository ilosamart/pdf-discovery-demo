about business continuity and contingencies for a firm to consider before the termination of any 

such relationship.   

Third, it is important to emphasize that guidance has to be read in the context of the 

relative risk and importance of the specific use-case in question.  We have long taken a risk-

focused supervisory approach--the level of scrutiny should be commensurate with the potential 

risk posed by the approach, tool, model, or process used.16  That principle also applies generally 

to the attention that supervised firms devote to the different approaches they use:  firms should 

apply more care and caution to a tool they use for major decisions or that could have a material 

impact on consumers, compliance, or safety and soundness.   

For its part, AI is likely to present some challenges in the areas of opacity and 

explainability.  Recognizing there are likely to be circumstances when using an AI tool is 

beneficial, even though it may be unexplainable or opaque, the AI tool should be subject to 

appropriate controls, as with any other tool or process, including how the AI tool is used in 

practice and not just how it is built.  This is especially true for any new application that has not 

been fully tested in a variety of conditions.  Given the large data sets involved with most AI 

approaches, it is vital to have controls around the various aspects of data--including data quality 

as well as data suitability.  Just as with conventional models, problems with the input data can 

lead to cascading problems down the line.  Accordingly, we would expect firms to apply robust 

analysis and prudent risk management and controls to AI tools, as they do in other areas, as well 

as to monitor potential changes and ongoing developments.
