standards are not “appropriate.”5  While this discretion may well be needed in particular cases, 

broad application of that approach would in effect require the Federal Reserve to develop new 

capital regimes for different segments of the financial system.  In declining to extend the $50 

billion standard to nonbank-affiliated firms, members of Congress may have been influenced by 

some of these considerations.  Again, if there are latent systemic risks in one or more of these 

segments, a more targeted, industry-wide response would be preferable.  Finally, any moral 

hazard that might be created by the designation process should be substantially offset by the 

specially applicable supervisory and regulatory requirements, to which I now turn. 

Implementing the Special Supervisory and Prudential Requirements 

 We are still the midst of developing the regulations that will set these requirements, as 

well as some related international initiatives, so I cannot this afternoon give you a full review of 

how the Federal Reserve will implement the rules required or authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act.  

I do, however, want to suggest a few principles that should inform the broader task of regulating 

and supervising the institutions covered by that statutory provision--whether through stricter 

capital and liquidity regulation, risk management, concentration limits, resolution plans, or the 

other mechanisms set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act.  I hasten to add that this is not an exhaustive 

list, but one designed to be suggestive of the directions in which systemic regulation should be 

heading. 

 First, and fundamentally, it is important to recognize that the purpose of this special 

regulatory regime is macroprudential.  It would be unrealistic, even dangerous, to believe that 

asset bubbles, excessive leverage, poor risk assessment, and the crises such phenomena produce 

can all be prevented.  The goal of the regulatory regime should be to reduce the likely incidence 

of such crises and, perhaps more importantly, to limit their severity when they do occur.   This
