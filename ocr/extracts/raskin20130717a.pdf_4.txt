their low yields and begin to seek higher yields by purchasing some specific higher-

yielding asset. If investors have access to credit, they might try to raise the return on their 

money by funding a greater portion of their purchases with debt. The asset purchased 

could serve to collateralize their loan. If many investors employ this strategy and they 

borrow to invest in the same asset, the price of that asset, and perhaps the prices of 

closely related assets as well, will increase noticeably faster than the historical trend.  

At the same time, increased demand for credit to finance these asset purchases 

could lead lenders to increase their reliance on less expensive, unstable short-term 

funding, such as uninsured deposits, commercial paper, or repo transactions, in order to 

fund the loans.  

Besides meeting customers’ growing demands for credit, financial intermediaries 

may themselves decide to “reach for yield” and take on additional risk in a low interest-

rate environment. Banks suffering compressed net interest margins because of low long-

term interest rates, money market funds facing an earnings squeeze, insurance companies 

that had promised minimum rates of return on their products, and others may all begin to 

take on higher interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk, or credit risk in search of 

higher returns. 

If these conditions seem likely to continue, an initial rise in the asset’s price leads 

to expectations of further increases, which adds to investor demand, spurring further 

borrowing and credit growth and increased household and financial sector leverage, 

which, in turn, could drive asset prices still higher. Rising asset prices, in turn, would 

increase the value of borrowers’ collateral, allowing still further borrowing.
