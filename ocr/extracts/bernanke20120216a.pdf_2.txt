It is a pleasure to speak at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) 

conference on the future of community banking.  This conference is indeed an important 

and timely one.  Community banks make a critical contribution to the prosperity of both 

their localities and the nation as a whole, which is why we at the Federal Reserve and the 

other banking agencies are acutely interested in their long-term strength and viability.

Today I will discuss the role community banking organizations play in supporting 

the health of our economy, as well as some of the challenges they face.  Because we 

greatly value our ongoing dialogue with community banks, I will also speak about the 

Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve our understanding of the pressures affecting 

community banks and to foster constructive supervisory relationships.   

The Role of Community Banks in a Challenging Economy  

Although community banks provide a wide range of services for their customers, 

their primary activities revolve around the traditional banking model--specifically, taking 

short-term deposits to fund longer-term investments, such as small business, agricultural, 

or commercial real estate loans.  Accordingly, risks at community banks tend to arise 

from their lending, in the form of credit risk, interest rate risk, or concentration risk, 

rather than from the trading, market-making, and investment banking activities associated 

with the largest banks.  However, by taking on and managing the risks of local lending, 

which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do, community banks help keep their 

local economies vibrant and growing.  Importantly, community banks are well positioned 

to go beyond the standardized credit models used by larger banks and consider a range of

 For purposes of these remarks, the terms “community bank” and “community banking organization” will 

be used interchangeably to refer to both banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets 

of $10 billion or less.
