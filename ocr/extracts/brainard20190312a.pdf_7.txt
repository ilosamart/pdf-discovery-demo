empowering low-income entrepreneurs.   

In other places, particularly in high-poverty and rural areas, I saw firsthand how

Delta in 2016, I heard from community members about having to drive long distances to 

deposit a check or access an ATM.  The same was true for my visits to Pine Ridge, South

to connect to the financial mainstream, which we want to recognize in any revisions to 

the CRA regulations.  Bankers and other commenters have emphasized the high value 

that bank branches have for retail customers and small business owners in underserved 

communities, and research corroborates this.   

Similar to banks, community organization commenters support updating the CRA

area defined for the purposes of pursuing meaningful community development activities, 

particularly in cases where banks operate largely without branches.  By allowing for more 

activity in a broader geographic area, they argue that the artificial competition for
