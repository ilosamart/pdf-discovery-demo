To explore recent loan and lease originations to small businesses, we can look at 

the PayNet/Thomson Reuters Small Business Lending Index (SBLI).  For inclusion in 

this index, a loan or lease must be originated to a business borrower who has total loan 

outstandings across all qualifying lenders of less than $1 million at both the start and the 

end of the month in question.  While some such loans and leases may be to established 

firms that employ more than 500 workers, small businesses are generally viewed as much 

more likely to borrow in these relatively small loan denominations.  The lenders that 

provide the data used to construct the index are banks and finance companies. 

The year-over-year changes in the SBLI are consistent with a view that loan 

originations are a pro-cyclical indicator (figure 8).  Strikingly, such year-over-year 

changes were mainly positive, but smaller through time, until the recent business cycle 

peak in December 2007.  During the recession, however, the year-over-year changes in 

the SBLI were increasingly negative until the business cycle trough, which occurred in 

June 2009.  Then, shortly after the recent business cycle trough, the year-over-year 

negative changes in the index became smaller until they turned positive in early 2010.  In 

February, the most recent month for which data are available, the SBLI measure of 

business loan and lease originations rose 15 percent from a year earlier.  

The seasonally adjusted index, which is normalized to 100 in January 2005, 

provides a different take on small business originations (figure 9).  This measure of 

lending, which allows comparisons across different months, has not yet rebounded to its 

level in mid-2007 even though many of the measures of small business owners’ and 

bankers’ perspectives have returned to their pre-recession levels.  Despite the magnitude 

of the rebound, there has been an apparent turnaround in loan and lease originations using
