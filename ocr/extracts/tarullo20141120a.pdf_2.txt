 The financial turbulence of 2008 was largely defined by the dangers of runs--realized, 

incipient, and feared.  Facing deep uncertainty about the condition of counterparties and the 

value of assets serving as collateral, many funding markets ground to a halt, as investors refused 

to offer new short-term lending or even to roll over existing repos and similar extensions of 

credit.  In the first instance, at least, this was a liquidity crisis.  Its fast-moving dynamic was very 

different from that of the savings and loan crisis or the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.  

The phenomenon of runs instead recalled a more distant banking crisis--that of the 1930s.   

 Despite this defining characteristic of the last crisis, measures to regulate liquidity have 

by-and-large lagged other regulatory reforms, for at least two reasons.  First, prior to the crisis 

there was very little use of quantitative liquidity regulation and thus little experience on which to 

draw.  While the Basel Committee got to work quickly, senior central bankers and heads of bank 

supervisory agencies extended the timeline for implementation of liquidity standards to guard 

against unanticipated, undesirable consequences from these innovative regulatory efforts.  A 

second reason liquidity regulation has followed other reforms is that judicious liquidity 

regulation both complements, and is dependent upon, other important financial policies--notably 

capital regulation, resolution procedures, and lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) practice.  Work on 

liquidity regulations has both built on reforms in these other areas and occasioned some 

consideration of the interaction among these various policies. 

 But while perhaps a bit drawn out, the work has proceeded.  A final version of a 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was agreed internationally and has been adopted by regulation
