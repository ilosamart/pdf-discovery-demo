financial market participants (not shown).18  Households’ longer-term expectations as 

reported in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the short-dashed blue line, 

have also been fairly stable overall since the late 1990s.19  That said, results from this 

survey, as well as a survey of consumers carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York, do hint that expectations may have slipped a bit over the past two or three years.  If 

so, stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than 

expected.20 

In theory, differences between yields on conventional Treasury securities and 

those on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are also informative about 

inflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for 

exposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices.  As indicated by the long-

dashed green line, TIPS inflation compensation for the five-year period starting five years 

from now has fallen roughly 1 percentage point over the past three years.  This decline 

                                                 
18 In the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median of 
respondents’ longer-term projections for PCE inflation have been essentially flat at 2 percent since the 
survey began in 2011.  Similarly, in the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey, which solicits the views of a 
large number of financial firms (as well as a few other institutions) about the extended outlook every June 
and December, the median of long-run expectations for GDP price inflation has stayed close to 2.1 percent 
over the past six years.  Comparisons of results from these surveys to those reported in the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (as well as surveys of households) are somewhat complicated by differences in the 
projection period used.  For example, some surveys include the low rates of inflation expected over the next 
few years in the calculation of projected longer-run averages, while other surveys exclude them. 
19 Expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years as reported in the Michigan survey runs appreciably above 
PCE price inflation on average since the mid-1990s, perhaps because households are less informed about 
actual inflation developments than professional forecasters and financial firms.  For this reason, it may be 
best to focus on changes over time in the Michigan measure, not on the level.   
20 In addition to monitoring survey measures of expected inflation, Federal Reserve staff also use statistical 
techniques to try to directly estimate possible movements over time in the underlying long-run trend in 
inflation, using data for actual inflation and other series, including resource utilization.  Many of these 
statistical estimates suggest that the underlying trend in PCE inflation is currently somewhat below 
2 percent.  Econometrically, however, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to disentangle estimates of 
the underlying trend in PCE inflation from estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment.  To be 
consistent with the data, the higher one’s estimate of trend inflation or expected long-run inflation, the 
lower must be one’s estimate of the sustainable unemployment rate, at least over the medium run.
