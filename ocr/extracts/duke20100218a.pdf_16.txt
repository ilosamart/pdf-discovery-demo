uncommon.  But I am proud of the Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to take immediate and 

forceful action.  As policymakers appropriately debate reforms to ensure that this never 

happens again, I hope they also ensure that if the unusual does happen, the Federal 

Reserve--or if not the Fed, some government entity--has all the tools and capabilities 

necessary to meet it head on.  And I further hope that wherever the authority resides, 

there are men and women of the caliber of those with whom I have been so fortunate to 

work at the Federal Reserve. 

As for me, I am still hoping to find out what a normal time at the Fed feels like.  

Thank you for honoring me and, by extension, all my colleagues with this distinguished 

award.
