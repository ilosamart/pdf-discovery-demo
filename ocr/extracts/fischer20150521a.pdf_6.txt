In response to these pressures, members of the EEC agreed in 1972 to the so-

called “snake”--or “the snake in the tunnel”--that attempted to limit exchange rate 

fluctuations of each currency relative to the dollar.10  However, this system was soon 

tested, notably by the oil crises of the 1970s, as both the effects of the oil price increases 

themselves and the policies adopted in response differed across countries.  Denmark and 

the United Kingdom exited the snake soon after entering, Italy dropped out in 1973, and 

France participated intermittently during the mid-1970s, first dropping out in 1974. 

The snake was a failure, a failure that created problems, though not clearly a 

crisis.  If exchange rates among members of the EEC were to be stabilized in the new 

world of floating rates, the Community had to invent a substitute.  In 1978, the members 

of the EEC created the European Monetary System, which started with an Exchange Rate 

Mechanism (ERM I) that limited currency fluctuations relative to a basket of national 

currencies.11  All members except the United Kingdom participated in ERM I.  The 

arrangement also committed central banks to intervene to support the resulting bilateral 

rates as they approached the limits of the permissible bands.  Countries in the ERM also 

adopted policies that lowered inflation, bringing interest rates into closer alignment.  The 

initial success of the ERM encouraged European leaders to lift capital controls and built 

momentum toward monetary union, which was reflected in the Maastricht Treaty (the 

Treaty on European Union), agreed to in 1991 and signed in 1992. 

However, strains also emerged under the ERM, in an environment in which the 

Bundesbank emerged as the dominant central bank in Europe, and the Deutschmark as
