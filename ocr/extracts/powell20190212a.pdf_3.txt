Challenges and Opportunities in Poor Rural Communities 

Today, data at the national level show a strong economy.  Unemployment is near 

a half-century low, and economic output is growing at a solid pace.  But we know that 

prosperity has not been felt as much in some areas, including many rural places.  The 

Federal Reserve can help by carrying out our monetary policy mission of supporting 

maximum employment and price stability.  We also support strong communities by 

conducting research, promoting community development, and enforcing laws like the 

Community Reinvestment Act, which helps ensure that people have adequate access to 

financial services wherever they live.  We not only work with communities, we are in 

communities, through the presence of our 12 regional Reserve Banks. 

Poverty remains a challenge in many rural communities.  Indeed, 70 percent of

measured by the U.S. Census Bureau in the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses (for more information, see
