the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higher-than-normal 

labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures.  As a result, a large portion of the rate 

cuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the 

earlier tight stance of monetary policy.  Of course, this situation could occur again in the 

future.  But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well 

above its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short-term interest rates by 

substantially more than 3 percentage points.   

A recent paper takes a different approach to assessing the FOMC’s ability to 

respond to future recessions by using simulations of the FRB/US model.19  This analysis 

begins by asking how the economy would respond to a set of highly adverse shocks if 

policymakers followed a fairly aggressive policy rule, hypothetically assuming that they 

can cut the federal funds rate without limit.20  It then imposes the zero lower bound and 

asks whether some combination of forward guidance and asset purchases would be 

sufficient to generate economic conditions at least as good as those that occur under the 

                                                 
19 FRB/US model simulations have several advantages for analyzing this issue.  For one, the model’s 

structure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, inflation, and other factors to take full account 

of the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary 

policy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases.  In addition, the model incorporates the low 

responsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects 

of asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar.  For a further discussion about the advantages (and possible 

disadvantages) of using the FRB/US model to study this issue, see Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of 

the FOMC to Respond to Future Recessions,“ in note 8. 
20 The aggressive rule is R(t) = 1.0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t)-2] - 2.0 [U(t) - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate, 

π is the four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate [Note:  On 

August 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8 - U(t)]” to 

“[U(t) - 4.8]”].  Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and 

the target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis--1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percent, 

respectively--are consistent with the medians of the latest long-run projections of individual FOMC 

participants.  As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity 

and inflation in a wide range of economic models (see John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B. 

Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), pp. 1-14).
