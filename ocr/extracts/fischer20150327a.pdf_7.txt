The fact that losses in what was a relatively small part of the mortgage market quickly 

spread through the rest of the financial system illustrates how the complex 

interconnections among banks and nonbanks can amplify shocks in significant and 

unanticipated ways. 

Some of the first cracks in the nonbank sector appeared in April 2007, when New 

Century Financial Corporation, at one point the second-biggest subprime mortgage 

lender, filed for bankruptcy after its creditors pulled back on fears about its losses.4  A 

few months later, with subprime assets falling in value, money market investors refused 

to roll over the asset-backed commercial paper that had been funding many of these 

subprime assets.  With this market shrinking dramatically, the banking sector was left on 

the hook to support entities that banks had sponsored or to which they had provided some 

form of credit or liquidity support. 

Around that same time, Bear Stearns, then one of the five largest investment 

banks, liquidated two of its hedge funds that invested in mortgage-based securities, 

including collateralized debt obligations, another link in the chain of transactions.  In 

March 2008, some creditors stopped funding Bear Stearns, and forced asset sales put 

additional downward pressure on asset prices. 

By the dramatic month of September 2008, the chain of interconnections had 

helped spread the financial pain, and a broader range of firms were caught in the financial 

maelstrom.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship.  Lehman Brothers 

failed when its creditors ran from it as they had from Bear Stearns.  American 

4 New Century Financial Corporation was not the first failure linked to the subprime crisis, but it is one of 
the first large failures.  For example, Ownit Mortgage Solutions, a California-based home lender partly 
owned by Merrill Lynch & Co., failed in December 2006.
