Inflation  

The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices is A 

Study of the Causes Regulating the Value of 

Money.  Its opening paragraph emphasizes the 

problem of inflation:   

“Changes in the general level of prices 

have always excited great interest.  

Obscure in origin, they exert a profound 

and far-reaching influence on the whole 

economic and social life of a country.”
