It is a great honor to deliver the Per Jacobsson Foundation Lecture, and I thank 

the organizers for inviting me.1  Per Jacobsson, a Swede, was the third Managing 

Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), serving from 1956 to 1963.  During

temporary fluctuations in international payments.

domestic product (GDP), and the ratio of total exports to global GDP now stands at about

has for many other countries, but it is an increasingly important driver of the U.S. 

economy, with the share of trade in U.S. GDP currently at about 15 percent.   

Although the U.S. share of world GDP has gradually declined since the mid-20th 

century, the broader importance of the United States to the global economy has 

diminished less, or possibly not at all, as a result of increasing financial linkages over the 

same period.  In particular, U.S. residents’ ownership of foreign assets has risen to nearly
