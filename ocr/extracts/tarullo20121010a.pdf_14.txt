standard.  Section 165 requires that the standards intended to prevent risks to financial stability 

increase in stringency, based on the same non-exhaustive list of factors used for the designation 

of nonbank systemically important financial firms,27 but provides no further guidance.   

In undertaking this task, we began with the premise that a financial stability motivation 

for capital requirements is necessarily somewhat different from the institution-centered approach 

of traditional capital standards, as embodied in the various Basel capital frameworks.  Firm-

centered requirements are informed by asking what level of capital would be necessary to allow 

the firm to remain a viable financial intermediary even after absorbing losses that, within a fairly 

high level of confidence, might be encountered over some relevant timeframe.  The financial 

stability approach begins from the fact that there would be very large negative externalities 

associated with the disorderly failure of any systemically important financial institution, distinct 

from the costs incurred by the firm and its stakeholders.  

The failure of such a firm, especially in a period of stress, significantly increases the 

chances that other financial firms will themselves experience great stress, for two reasons.  First, 

direct counterparty impacts can lead to a classic domino effect.  Second, because losses in a tail 

event are much more likely to be correlated for firms deeply engaged in trading, structured 

products, and other capital market instruments, all such firms are vulnerable to accelerating 

losses as troubled firms sell their assets into a declining market.  Enhanced capital requirements 

should take into account these costs that a systemically important firm’s failure will inflict on the 

rest of the financial system, not the amount of loss its shareholders and creditors will incur.  

Thus, the aim of financial stability capital standards is to reduce further the probability that the 

firm might fail under stress through holding additional capital.  These additional capital
