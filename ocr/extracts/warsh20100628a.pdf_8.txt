 Fiscal policymakers must wrestle with difficult questions of timing, external 

conditions, economic potential, and policy credibility.  Ultimately, in my view, fiscal

surviving features of the Fed’s extraordinary actions is the breadth of tools at our 

disposal.  They comprise a handy set, and should remind us that every problem is not a 

nail.  And that we have more than the hammer in our toolkit.  By considering,
