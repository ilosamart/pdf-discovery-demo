different perspectives.  Both of these sessions provided cause for optimism about the 

future relevance and importance of community banks while simultaneously raising 

concerns about the viability of the very smallest banking organizations. 

In my remarks today, I would like to explore this mixed message a bit further and 

ask what the observed trends in the data imply for todayâ€™s community bankers and the 

communities they serve.  In doing so, I will look at changes in the community banking 

sector at a national level and will also look at geographic patterns of community bank 

growth and decline.  For purposes of these remarks, I will define community banks as 

those with less than $10 billion in assets, although my conclusions would be the same if I 

used a lower cutoff, such as $1 billion in assets, or a more detailed definition of 

community banks, such as that developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(FDIC) a few years ago.1  As always, the views I express here today are my own.  

I will start by discussing figures showing the number of community banks 

operating in the United States over the past 20 years.  Figure 1 shows the number of 

community banks for each year from 1995 to 2015.  It shows a steady decline in the 

number of such banks over time.  The rate of decline is considerably steeper in the late 

1990s than in the period from 2000 to 2010.  In the past five years, the rate of decrease 

has accelerated somewhat but remains slower than that experienced in the late 1990s.  

Breaking the universe of community banks down into subgroups based on size, 

we can see that the decline in community bank numbers is far from uniform.2  The 

number of banks with between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets has doubled since 1995

2 All asset sizes are converted to 2005 dollars, so the changes in size distribution cannot be attributed to 
inflation.
