market?  Wouldn’t it be better to use a more narrowly focused supervisory or regulatory 

approach, with less potential for damage to the economy? 

A related concern is that monetary policy already has its hands full with the dual 

mandate, and that if it is also made partially responsible for financial stability, it will have 

more objectives than instruments at its disposal and won’t do as well with any of its 

tasks.

  These are important points to bear in mind.  In some cases, supervisory and 

regulatory tools are clearly better targeted and more likely to be effective than monetary 

policy could be.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory responsibilities for the 

banking sector put it in the right position to carefully monitor duration risk in banks’ 

securities portfolios and to take corrective action if necessary. 

Nevertheless, as we move forward, I believe it will be important to keep an open 

mind and avoid adhering to the decoupling philosophy too rigidly.  In spite of the caveats 

I just described, I can imagine situations where it might make sense to enlist monetary 

policy tools in the pursuit of financial stability.  Let me offer three observations in 

support of this perspective.  First, despite much recent progress, supervisory and 

regulatory tools remain imperfect in their ability to promptly address many sorts of 

financial stability concerns.  If the underlying economic environment creates a strong 

incentive for financial institutions to, say, take on more credit risk in a reach for yield, it 

is unlikely that regulatory tools can completely contain this behavior.  This, of course, is 

not to say that we should not try to do our best with these tools--we absolutely should.  

But we should also be realistic about their limitations.  These limitations arise because of

 This concern is sometimes related to the “Tinbergen principle” (Tinbergen (1952)), which states that if 

the number of policy targets exceeds the number of instruments, then some targets may not be hit.  

However in a world with multiple instruments, the Tinbergen principle does not imply anything about 

decoupling.  That is, it does not imply that each instrument must be dedicated to a single target.
