borrowing of less than 30 days’ maturity, the LCR kicks in and requires the dealer to hold 

high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) against the risk that it is unable to roll the repo over.  

In this particular case, there can be said to be a direct form of regulatory attack on the 

fire-sales problem.  However, this conclusion is sensitive to the details of the example.  

If, instead of holding a corporate bond, the dealer holds a Treasury security that is 

deemed to count as Level 1 HQLA, there is no impact of the LCR.   

Moreover, the LCR plays no role in mitigating fire-sales externalities in the 

important matched-book case in which the dealer acts as an intermediary.10 If a dealer 

borrows on a collateralized basis with repo and then turns around and lends the proceeds 

to a hedge fund in a similar fashion, the LCR deems the dealer to have no net liquidity 

exposure—and hence imposes no incremental liquidity requirement—so long as the 

lending side of the transaction has a maturity of less than 30 days.  The implicit logic is 

that as long as the dealer can generate the necessary cash by not rolling over its loan to 

the hedge fund, it will always be able to handle any outflows of funding that come from 

being unable to roll over its own borrowing.  This logic is not incorrect per se, but it is 

very micro-focused in nature, and does not attend to fire-sales externalities. It worries 

about the ability of the dealer firm to survive a liquidity stress event, but does not take 

into account that the dealer’s survival may come at the cost of forcing its hedge fund 

client to engage in fire sales.11     

                                                 
10 A similar comment applies to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires regulated firms to 
fund illiquid exposures with some amount of long-term debt or other form of stable funding.  Like the 
LCR, the NSFR effectively treats matched-book repo as creating no net liquidity exposure, and hence 
imposes no requirement on it.  
 
11 Even from a microprudential perspective, the LCR can be said to have a flaw in that it is blind to 
maturity mismatches within the 30-day window.  For example, if a dealer borrows on an overnight basis 
from a money fund, and then makes a 29-day loan to a hedge fund, the LCR deems it to be fully matched, 
and to have no incremental liquidity exposure.
