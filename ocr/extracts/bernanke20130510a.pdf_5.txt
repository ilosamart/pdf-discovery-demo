designate systemically important institutions, market utilities, and activities for additional 

oversight.  Such designation is essentially a determination that an institution or activity 

creates or exacerbates a vulnerability of the financial system, a determination that can 

only be made with comprehensive monitoring and analysis. 

The second motivation for more intensive monitoring is the apparent tendency for 

financial market participants to take greater risks when macro conditions are relatively 

stable.  Indeed, it may be that prolonged economic stability is a double-edged sword.  To 

be sure, a favorable overall environment reduces credit risk and strengthens balance 

sheets, all else being equal, but it could also reduce the incentives for market participants 

to take reasonable precautions, which may lead in turn to a buildup of financial 

vulnerabilities.  Probably our best defense against complacency during extended periods 

of calm is careful monitoring for signs of emerging vulnerabilities and, where 

appropriate, the development of macroprudential and other policy tools that can be used 

to address them. 

The Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Monitoring Program 

So, what specifically does the Federal Reserve monitor?  In the remainder of my 

remarks, I’ll highlight and discuss four components of the financial system that are 

among those we follow most closely:  systemically important financial institutions 

(SIFIs), shadow banking, asset markets, and the nonfinancial sector.

 The remainder of my remarks draws heavily on Tobias Adrian, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), 

“Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-21 (Washington:  Board 

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April), 

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf.  This paper provides more details on the 

Federal Reserve’s financial stability monitoring program.  I thank the authors for their assistance with these 

remarks.
