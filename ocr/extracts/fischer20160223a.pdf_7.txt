policy tightening, which could inadvertently push the economy into recession.  Monetary 

policy should aim to avoid such risks and keep the expansion on a sustainable track.   

The second issue is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate 

policy.  The FOMC has indicated that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no 

more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively--

which will require us to reduce the size of our balance sheet substantially.  But that 

statement leaves open the question of when we should begin that process.  Because the 

tools I mentioned earlier--the payment of interest on reserve balances and the overnight 

reverse repurchase facility--can be used to raise the federal funds rate independent of the 

size of the balance sheet, we have the flexibility to adjust the size of our balance sheet at 

the appropriate time.  With the federal funds rate still quite low and expected to rise only 

gradually, there is some benefit to maintaining a larger balance sheet for a time.  Doing 

so should help support accommodative financial conditions and so reduce the risks to the 

economy in the event of an adverse shock.  Consistent with this view, the Committee has 

decided to continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities portfolio until 

normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way.  The decision about when to 

cease or begin phasing out reinvestment will depend on how economic and financial 

conditions and the economic outlook evolve.4   

With that background, I thank you for listening, and look forward to continuing 

the discussion, initially with Dan Yergin.
