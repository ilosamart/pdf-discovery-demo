balancing the benefits of innovation with the safe and reliable operation of systems and critical 

activities.  

 From an analytical perspective, payment systems typically increase in value as more 

people use a system and the more attractive it becomes to others.  In addition, there is an inverse 

relationship between the volume of users of a system and the cost of production--more users 

lower the cost of production.  Until recently, these features may have hindered innovation by 

presenting high barriers to entry and may have also fostered greater concentration into a few key 

entities that could become systemically important.1  Of course, technology may be able to reduce 

the effect of at least some of these hurdles by, for example, attracting high numbers of users 

quickly or reducing the costs of production.  However, the effect of reducing technological 

barriers for financial stability is not clearly positive or negative.  For example, on the one hand, 

new market participants attracted by lower barriers to entry may introduce new and unknown 

risks in the payment system.  On the other hand, new market participants may relieve the 

concentration of activity in a limited number of players. 

Thus, the potential tension between innovation and stability can be more difficult to 

manage in the case of payment systems as compared to other industries that are less affected by 

these hurdles.  One sensible approach to risk management would emphasize “starting small” and 

taking small risks.  But unless a payment system grows a fairly large network of users in a 

reasonable time, it is unlikely to achieve the scope and scale it needs to be successful.  

Conversely, if a system attempts to start on a large scale and is successful, there will surely be 

questions about resilience in adversity, particularly if cutting-edge technologies and methods are 

used to handle people’s money.  The essential problem is how to achieve scale and manage
