of the United States dollar. As other countries expand, they

become better markets for our goods and, if we expand more rapidly 

then they do, our people become major importers, thus shifting the 

balance of trade and causing an outflow of funds. Exchange rate 

instabilities can cause some disruption and problems in international 

markets, but the prospect for greater instability does not seem 

markedly different today than in the past.

Perhaps one of the greatest uncertainties though, both at 

home and abroad, is the question of the degree of inflation. It 

is pointless to review the history of inflation except to learn from 

the causes or to point out the double-digit levels of 1974 or the 

decline in those levels in 1975. Our concern is with the future.

If external pressures can be kept under reasonable control and if 

food shortages do not create sudden and unexpected adverse effects, 

the primary question on inflationary pressures within the United States 

must be the rate of wage increases. The year 1976 will be one in 

which there are major union contracts coming up for renegotiation.

If the wage and benefit increases from such negotiations can be kept 

at or below the pace in 1975, then the United States has an excellent 

opportunity to develop a broadly based and relatively balanced 

recovery with lower inflationary pressures and a return to high-level 

resource utilization.
