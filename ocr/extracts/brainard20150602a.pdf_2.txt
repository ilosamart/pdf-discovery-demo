This spring marks the end of the Federal Reserve’s calendar-based forward 

guidance and the return to full data dependency in the setting of the federal funds rate.  

So it is notable that just as policymaking is becoming more anchored in meeting-by-

meeting assessments of the data, the data are presenting a mixed picture that lends itself 

to materially different readings.1 

No doubt, bad weather, port disruptions, and statistical issues are responsible for 

some of the softness in first-quarter indicators of aggregate spending.  Indeed, it may be 

that the dismal estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the annualized change in 

first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), negative 0.7 percent, is principally an 

extension of the pattern, seen for several years, of significantly slower measured GDP 

growth in the first quarter followed by considerably stronger readings during the 

remainder of the year.  In that case, it would be appropriate to minimize the importance 

of the first-quarter estimate in judging the likely path of the economy over the remainder 

of the year.  

But there may be reasons not to ignore the recent readings entirely.  First, the 

limited data in hand pertaining to the second quarter do not suggest a significant 

bounceback in aggregate spending, which we would expect if all of the weakness in the 

first quarter were due to transitory factors.  Private-sector forecasts of second-quarter 

growth are centered around 2-1/2 percent, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s
