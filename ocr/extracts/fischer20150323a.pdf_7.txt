the Committeeâ€™s policy intentions.13  In brief, unconventional policies helped bring down 

long-term yields both by reducing term premia and by lowering the expected path of 

future short-term rates.  

The Recovery from the Financial Crisis 

Despite monetary stimulus, the recovery from the financial crisis has been even 

more sluggish than we had expected.  The slow recovery provides more evidence that 

severe financial crises have long-lived effects, as Reinhart and Rogoff, and others, have 

documented.14   

The gradual pace of the recovery has likely reflected both demand and supply 

factors.  With respect to aggregate demand, the economy faced several important 

headwinds: efforts by households and businesses to rebuild their balance sheets, 

persistently tight credit conditions, the extreme weakness of the housing sector, the 

significant drag from fiscal policy in the years from 2011 to 2013, and the growth

One notable manifestation of slow productivity growth is that last year, unemployment 

fell significantly further than we had anticipated as of the start of the year--a pattern that 

occurred in the prior four years as well--whereas gross domestic product growth fell short 

of our expectations, as it had in three of the four prior years.  However, productivity is
