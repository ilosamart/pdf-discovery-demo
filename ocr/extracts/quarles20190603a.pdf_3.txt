The ARRC has provided these tools.  Now it is up to you to begin using them.  

With only two and a half years of further guaranteed stability for LIBOR, the transition 

should begin happening in earnest.  I believe that the ARRC has chosen the most viable 

path forward and that most will benefit from following it, but regardless of how you 

choose to transition, beginning that transition now would be consistent with prudent risk 

management and the duty that you owe to your shareholders and clients.  

The ARRC’s work began by focusing on creating a derivatives market for the 

Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar 

LIBOR, because end users require derivatives markets to hedge their cash exposures.  

The CME Group, LCH, and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, all now offer futures or 

swaps markets on SOFR, and participation in these markets is growing.  As liquidity in 

these markets continues to develop, my hope is that many of you will avail yourselves of 

them to close out your LIBOR positions.  In the meantime, it will be crucial in ensuring 

global financial stability that everyone participate in the International Swaps and 

Derivatives Association’s (ISDA) consultations on better fallback language for LIBOR 

derivatives and then sign the ISDA protocol so that these fallbacks apply to the legacy 

book of derivatives.  

Likewise, the ARRC has now offered better fallback language for new issuance of 

cash products that refer to LIBOR.  It seems clear that much of the contract language 

being used currently did not envisage and is not designed for a permanent end to LIBOR.  

The ARRC’s fallback recommendations represent a significant body of work on the part 

of a wide set of market participants and set out a robust and well-considered set of steps
