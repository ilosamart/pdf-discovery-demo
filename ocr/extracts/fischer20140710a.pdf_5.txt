But at what level should capital and liquidity ratios be set?  In practice, the base 

from which countries work is agreement among the regulators and supervisors who 

belong to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).  At one time the 

membership consisted of the members of the G-10 plus Switzerland.  It now includes the 

membership of the G-20 plus a few other countries.5     

Following the global crisis, the BCBS moved to the Basel III agreement, which 

strengthens capital requirements, as opposed to Basel II, which tried to build primarily on 

measures of risk capital set by internal models developed by each individual bank.  This 

approach did not work, partly because the agreed regulatory minimum capital ratios were 

too low, but also because any set of risk weights involves judgments, and human nature 

would rarely result in choices that made for higher risk weights.  In the United States, the 

new regulations require large bank holding companies (BHCs) to use risk-weighted 

assets (RWAs) that are the greater of those produced by firms’ internal models or the 

standardized risk weights, some of which have been raised, thus mitigating the problem 

of the use of internal risk ratings.   

What has been achieved?  Globally 

• The minimum tier 1 capital ratio has been raised from 4 percent to 6 percent of 

RWA. 

• There is a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent of RWA.
