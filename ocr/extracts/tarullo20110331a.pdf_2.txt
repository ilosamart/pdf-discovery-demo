stability” a prominent place in the lexicon of policymakers.  Although protecting financial 

stability is germane to numerous areas, including monetary policy, today I will focus on some 

aspects of its relevance for financial regulation.  More specifically, I will address the 

implementation of the new statutory regime for special supervision and regulation of financial 

institutions whose stress or failure could pose a risk to financial stability.  Then I will identify 

two important issues raised by the implementation of this regime that need the attention of 

academics, analysts, and policymakers if we are to regulate systemic risk effectively and 

efficiently.1  

Distressed Firms and Systemic Risk 

 Let me start by detailing how distress in a financial firm can create risks to overall 

financial stability, as a prelude to suggesting how an understanding of those dynamics should 

inform prudential regulatory policies.  There are basically four ways:  

 First is the classic domino effect, whereby counterparties of a failing firm are placed 

under severe strain when the firm does not meet its financial obligations to them.  Their 

resulting inability to meet their own obligations leads, in turn, to severe strains at their 

other significant counterparties, and so on through the financial system.   

 Second is a fire-sale effect in asset markets, when a failing firm engages in distress sales 

in an effort to obtain needed liquidity.  The sudden increase in market supply of the assets 

drives down prices, often substantially.  As we saw in the recent crisis, this effect 

transmits not only to firms that must sell assets to meet immediate liquidity needs but, 

because of margin calls and mark-to-market accounting requirements, to many other
