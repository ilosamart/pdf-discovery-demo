Reinvestment Act, and we are interested in your comments regarding ways we can 

improve the regulation.   

 In addition to changes in the regulatory and supervisory landscape, the banking 

industry itself has also undergone major changes.  Advances in technology and shifts in 

industry composition between depository institutions and nondepository companies have 

changed the types of financial services and products that are offered, as well as how those 

services and products are accessed.  We will be very interested in your feedback 

regarding how these types of industry changes have impacted the effectiveness of our 

regulations.  

 Let me conclude by saying that we will consider your comments carefully as the 

agencies coordinate to discuss and consider the appropriate action that is likely to best 

serve our financial system and the interests of institutions and consumers.  The result will 

be contained in the agencies’ report to the Congress summarizing the issues raised and 

the agencies’ conclusions about the need for regulatory or legislative changes.  

 Thank you for joining us today.
