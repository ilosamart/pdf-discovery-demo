Asset purchases have complemented our forward guidance, and the many 

dimensions of different purchase programs arguably constitute “many instruments.”  In 

designing a purchase program, one must consider which assets to buy:  Just Treasury 

securities or agency mortgage-backed securities as well?  Which maturities?  The Federal 

Reserve, the Bank of England, and, more recently, the Bank of Japan have emphasized 

longer-duration securities.  At what pace should the securities be purchased?  And how 

long should they be held once purchases cease?  Each of these factors may affect the 

degree of accommodation delivered.  Two innovations in the FOMC’s current asset 

purchase program, for example, are that it is open-ended rather than fixed in size like past 

programs, and that the overall size of the program is explicitly linked to seeing a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.   

In these brief remarks, I won’t thoroughly review the benefits or costs of our 

highly accommodative policies, emphasizing only that I believe they have, on net, 

provided meaningful support to the recovery.  But I do want to spend a moment on one 

potential cost--financial stability--because this topic returns us to the theme of “many 

targets” for central banks.  As Chairman Bernanke has observed, in the years before the 

crisis, financial stability became a “junior partner” in the monetary policy process, in 

contrast with its traditionally larger role.  The greater focus on financial stability is 

probably the largest shift in central bank objectives wrought by the crisis.   

Some have asked whether the extraordinary accommodation being provided in 

response to the financial crisis may itself tend to generate new financial stability risks.  

This is a very important question.  To put it in context, let’s remember that the Federal 

Reserve’s policies are intended to promote a return to prudent risk-taking, reflecting a
