economic information and its implications for the outlook.  Uncertainty about future 

employment and inflation naturally translates into uncertainty about the path of future 

monetary policy.   

One useful measure of uncertainty is the magnitude of forecast errors, or the 

extent to which macroeconomic outcomes have differed from professional economic 

forecasters’ expectations.2  Over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the unemployment 

rate four quarters ahead have missed the actual unemployment rate by more than 3/4 

percentage point in either direction one-third of the time.  Since notable departures from 

forecast values of unemployment and inflation occur with some frequency, it should not 

be surprising that the associated forecasts of interest rates have a similar track record. 

One-third of the time over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the level of short-term 

interest rates four quarters ahead have been above or below the actual level by more than 

1-1/4 percentage points.3  Thus, it is important to keep in mind that all macro forecasts 

and projections of monetary policy are subject to considerable uncertainty, as they are 

based on information at a point in time, and actual developments could well evolve much 

differently.  

Fiscal Policy Considerations 

Among the many factors that can affect the aggregate economy and, by extension, 

monetary policy, a possible shift in fiscal policy has attracted the attention of both 

economic forecasters and financial markets of late.  Among forecasters surveyed by Blue 

Chip Economic Indicators, for 2017, 44 percent indicated that they had raised their

of Philadelphia’s November Survey of Professional Forecasters.  For more on the construction of forecast 
errors, see Reifschneider and Tulip (2007) and Board of Governors (2014).
