for systemically important institutions to constrain risk-taking by those firms whose 

failures would pose the greatest systemic risk.  One approach could involve imposing 

penalties or restrictions on financial firms based on factors such as the correlation of their 

strategies with those of other firms or by limiting risk exposure to individual 

counterparties.  

Policies are on the drawing board to ensure that institutions avoid undue reliance 

on short-term debt and have adequate liquidity in market downturns.  Such requirements 

would diminish the risk of the shortfalls and hoarding that could fuel a credit market 

meltdown.  Policymakers might additionally put in place policies to discourage 

overreliance on short-term debt among investors more broadly through, for example, 

regulations on repo haircuts.  To address unsustainable real estate price run-ups, some 

countries have chosen to cap maximum loan-to-value ratios on home loans.  Such an 

approach deserves serious consideration.  My expectation is that policies such as these 

will restrict dangerous pro-cyclical movements in debt and leverage, diminish the extent 

of maturity mismatches and the potential for runs, and discourage unsustainable asset 

price appreciation.  Importantly, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators have also 

taken steps to ensure that the financial institutions we supervise enforce compensation 

policies that control incentives for excessive pro-cyclical risk-taking.   

Macroprudential supervision must be particularly attentive to risks that could 

impair the plumbing of the financial system--that is, the payments, clearing, and 

settlements systems--where breakdowns would relay and amplify systemic risk.  

Importantly, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly increases the trading of derivatives on
