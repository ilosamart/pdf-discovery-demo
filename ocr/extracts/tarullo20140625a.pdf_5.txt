and financial conditions typical of a severe post-World War II U.S. recession.2  In devising 

recession scenarios, we draw on many of the same macroeconomic modeling tools used in 

making monetary policy.  Because not all significant risks facing banks are tied to the business 

cycle, our scenarios now incorporate other adverse developments such as an exceptionally large 

decline in house prices, sharp drops in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a 

worsening of global economic conditions more severe than might normally be expected to 

accompany a deep recession in the United States.  We have implemented the Dodd-Frank 

requirement for an “adverse,” as well as a “severely adverse,” scenario not by simply 

hypothesizing a milder recession, but by testing for somewhat different risks.  The past two years 

we have used the adverse scenario to test the impact of a sudden, significant increase in interest 

rates. 

More discrete changes of note include the assumption of default by each firm’s largest 

counterparty and the incorporation of salient risks beyond those in the overall scenarios.3  The 

former obviously serves a microprudential purpose, but it also could promote systemic stability 

objectives if it were to identify a single exceptionally large exposure for the entire financial 

system.  The incorporation of salient risks helps to use stress tests to “lean against the wind,” not 

just build a buffer for future losses.  For example, the 2011 and 2012 scenarios incorporated 

possible severe stress in Europe.  Inclusion of this factor may have led to greater awareness and 

better risk management of U.S. firms’ European exposures.
