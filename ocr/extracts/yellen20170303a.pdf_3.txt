I should note that I will discuss the process of scaling back accommodation 

mostly from the perspective of our interest rate decisions, which my FOMC colleagues 

and I see as our primary tool for actively adjusting the stance of monetary policy when 

our actions are not constrained by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1 

Assessing the Degree of Monetary Policy Accommodation 

In our monetary policy deliberations, the FOMC always faces two fundamental 

questions:  First, how do we assess the current stance of monetary policy?  Second, what 

are the strategic and tactical considerations that underpin our decisions about the 

appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward?  These questions are difficult 

because the interactions between monetary policy and the economy are complex.  Policy 

affects the economy through many different channels, and, in turn, many factors 

influence the appropriate course of policy.   

Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of 

what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time.  A useful concept in this 

regard is the neutral “real” federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate 

that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the 

economy is operating near its potential.  In effect, a “neutral” policy stance is one where 

monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator.  

Although the concept of the neutral real federal funds rate is exceptionally useful in 

assessing policy, it is difficult in practical terms to know with precision where that rate 

                                                 
1 When the federal funds rate was near zero and we felt the economy still needed more support, the FOMC 
acted, beginning in 2008, to purchase longer-term securities.  Although we stopped increasing the size of 
our securities portfolio in 2014, we have been reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings 
ever since.  We have said that we expect to maintain this policy until normalization of the level of the 
federal funds rate is well under way.  We have also said that, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the 
size of our balance sheet, we will do so primarily by letting maturing assets run off our balance sheet.
