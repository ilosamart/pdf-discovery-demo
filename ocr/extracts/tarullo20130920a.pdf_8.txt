to arise from vulnerabilities to common stresses, and severe problems at such firms are 

far more likely to exacerbate systemic weaknesses.  Since the health of any one of these 

large institutions is tied to the health of these firms as a group, good microprudential 

regulation may itself require a macroprudential dimension.     

The reorientation of the Federal Reserve’s supervision of large, complex financial 

firms is reflected organizationally in the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating 

Committee (LISCC).  The LISCC was created three years ago to facilitate the execution 

of horizontal, cross-firm analysis of the largest firms and to centralize supervision of 

these firms so as to promote an integrated and consistent supervisory approach.  The 

LISCC includes senior staff not only from the supervisory staffs of the Board and 

Reserve Banks, but also from the Board’s Office of Financial Stability, Division of 

Monetary Affairs, Division of Research and Statistics, and other relevant divisions.  This 

“interdisciplinary” approach to large bank supervision not only fosters more rigorous 

microprudential regulation, it also facilitates and formalizes a broader look at systemic 

risks by using quantitative methods to evaluate macroeconomic and financial risks, and 

how they could affect individual firms and the firms collectively.   

2.  Building Greater Resiliency is Central to the Macroprudential Regulation of 

Large Financial Institutions.  In early 2009 there was widespread doubt about the 

solvency of the financial system as a whole, particularly at many of the large firms that 

had directly or indirectly been deeply involved in mortgage markets and associated 

securitizations.  When we created the first supervisory stress test on the fly, as it were, 

our aim was to stabilize, and restore confidence in, the financial system as a whole by 

ensuring that the 19 largest bank holding companies were sufficiently capitalized that
