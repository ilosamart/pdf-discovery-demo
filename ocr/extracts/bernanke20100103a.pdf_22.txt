were insufficient to stop the decline in underwriting standards and effectively constrain 

the housing bubble. 

The lesson I take from this experience is not that financial regulation and 

supervision are ineffective for controlling emerging risks, but that their execution must be 

better and smarter.  The Federal Reserve is working not only to improve our ability to 

identify and correct problems in financial institutions, but also to move from an 

institution-by-institution supervisory approach to one that is attentive to the stability of 

the financial system as a whole.  Toward that end, we are supplementing reviews of 

individual firms with comparative evaluations across firms and with analyses of the 

interactions among firms and markets.  We have further strengthened our commitment to 

consumer protection.  And we have strongly advocated financial regulatory reforms, such 

as the creation of a systemic risk council, that will reorient the country’s overall 

regulatory structure toward a more systemic approach.  The crisis has shown us that 

indicators such as leverage and liquidity must be evaluated from a systemwide 

perspective as well as at the level of individual firms. 

Is there any role for monetary policy in addressing bubbles?  Economists have 

pointed out the practical problems with using monetary policy to pop asset price bubbles, 

and many of these were illustrated by the recent episode.  Although the house price 

bubble appears obvious in retrospect--all bubbles appear obvious in retrospect--in its 

earlier stages, economists differed considerably about whether the increase in house 

prices was sustainable; or, if it was a bubble, whether the bubble was national or confined 

to a few local markets.  Monetary policy is also a blunt tool, and interest rate increases in 

2003 or 2004 sufficient to constrain the bubble could have seriously weakened the
