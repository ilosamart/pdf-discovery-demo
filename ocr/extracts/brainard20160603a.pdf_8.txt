Thus, while the easing in financial conditions since mid-February is very 

welcome, it is important to recognize that some of the conditions underlying recent bouts 

of turmoil largely remain in place, and an important reason for the fading of this 

turbulence was the expectation of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening.7  

Should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the 

policy reaction function in the United States, turbulence could well return.   

Policy Implications 

On balance, recent developments have signaled continued progress toward our 

goals.  While signs of weakness in business investment and global demand remain, 

consumption and residential investment have held firm, and the labor market has moved 

closer to full employment.  At the same time, the relative stabilization in the dollar and 

oil prices in recent months has boosted somewhat the likelihood of a return to 2 percent 

inflation over the medium term.  However, the data on progress toward our inflation 

objective are equivocal.  Measures of underlying inflation have yet to convincingly signal 

a move back to 2 percent, and inflation expectations appear low, as I noted earlier. 

I want to emphasize that monetary policy is data dependent and is not on a preset 

course.  In this regard, I look forward to hearing the deliberations of the Committee.  

Recognizing the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still 

limited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an 

advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence.  Prudent risk-

management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides 

                                                 
value that investors attach to Treasury securities because the price of Treasuries would be expected to rise 

if there are adverse shocks to the global economy.

conditions, see Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016).
