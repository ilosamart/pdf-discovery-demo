of international policy initiatives within their respective regions, but also to be in a strong 

position to keep abreast of developments in financial markets and thus inform FSB policy.  We 

have initiated a study of the operations of the regional groups that will help inform us on ways to 

upgrade their effectiveness as an outreach and feedback mechanism.  I am particularly interested 

in how we can take lessons learned from this study to move forward with our enhanced 

engagement.  

Engagement outside of the FSB is also very important to our mission.  We currently 

engage with businesses, institutions, market participants, and academics on much of our FSB 

work.  For example, we have in the past conducted public consultations on FSB policy 

recommendations, albeit sometimes with very short timetables.  We have now established an 

expectation that public consultation will be at least 60 days.  We need to give the public adequate 

time to comment on FSB proposals, which can, at times, be quite complex.  

Beyond public consultation, we must convene more meetings with the private sector and 

academic community to build a more robust and meaningful dialogue.  For example, we kicked 

off the work we have undertaken at the behest of the Japanese G20 Presidency to study 

differences in regulatory environments and market conditions across jurisdictions that may have 

financial stability implications--often referred to as “market fragmentation”--by hosting a 

workshop with key stakeholders and academics.  This was quite successful, and I look forward to 

such interactions being the rule.  In addition, we need to improve our interaction and cooperation 

with other standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee, the Committee on Payments 

and Market Infrastructure, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and the 

International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).  While we have worked together
