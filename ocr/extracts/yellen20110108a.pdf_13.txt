This observation is in accord with the recent behavior of inflation, which, as noted above, 

has trended down over the past three years, consistent with a decline in rates of resource 

utilization.  Likewise, nominal wage growth has fallen noticeably over the past several 

years and remains quite low. 

  In sum, while deficient labor demand may not be the only factor boosting 

unemployment currently, and while disentangling the various influences on 

unemployment is not straightforward, weak labor demand appears to be the predominant 

factor keeping the unemployment rate elevated.  This weakness, in turn, implies that 

current resource utilization is likely well below normal levels, mitigating the risk that the 

policy stimulus from our asset purchase program will lead to excessive inflation. 

Inflation and bank reserves.  A second reason that some observers worry that the 

Fedâ€™s asset purchase programs could raise inflation is that these programs have increased 

the quantity of bank reserves far above pre-crisis levels.  I strongly agree with one aspect 

of this argument--the notion that an accommodative monetary policy left in place too 

long can cause inflation to rise to undesirable levels.  This notion would be true 

regardless of the level of bank reserves and pertains as well in situations in which 

monetary policy is unconstrained by the zero bound on interest rates.  Indeed, it is one 

reason why the Committee stated that it will review its asset purchase program regularly 

in light of incoming information and adjust the program as needed to meet its objectives. 

We recognize that the FOMC must withdraw monetary stimulus once the recovery has 

taken hold and the economy is improving at a healthy pace.  Importantly, the Committee 

remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the 

                                                                                                                                                 
increase layoffs--an outward shift in the Beveridge curve.  For the response of vacancies and layoffs to 
changes in firm-level employment, see Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2010).
