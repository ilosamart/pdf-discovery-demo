The personal assets of small business owners have been an important source of 

capital for entrepreneurs as they seek to start and sustain a small business.  As wealth for 

middle-income households has stagnated, reliance on this source of capital has declined 

in recent years.40  Very small firms depend heavily on personal debt for start-up and 

working capital.  Owners of smaller firms often struggle to qualify for bank credit, and 

among those that apply and are denied, low credit scores and insufficient credit history 

are the most frequently cited reasons.   

More broadly, a key reason that middle-income households have not seen wealth 

increases commensurate with high-income households is that they have not benefited as 

much from the strong performance of stocks and privately held businesses.  In inflation-

adjusted terms, total business assets (including corporate stocks, mutual funds, and 

unincorporated businesses) have more than tripled since 1989.  Similarly, the average 

business assets of top-income households have more than tripled since 1989.  But the 

average business assets of middle-income families have grown only 31 percent since 

1989 and are lower than they were before the Great Recession (figure 12).   Stock market 

participation fell for middle-income families after the Great Recession, so they have not 

benefited as much from the subsequent rise in stock prices.41  By 2018, the 30 percent of 

households in the middle of the income distribution held only 6 percent of aggregate 

business assets, while the top 10 percent of households held over three-fourths.
