additional opportunities to use the lessons of the recent crisis as local leaders strive to better 

understand the root cause of high vacancy levels and to target limited resources.  Consider the 

situation faced by Oklahoma City. 

 Oklahoma City estimates that 8,000 urban properties have been vacant for more than 

three years, and that the number of vacancies is increasing.24  The city’s historically high housing 

vacancies mostly stem from cultural and demographic changes that have occurred over decades, 

as well as inadequate building code laws and enforcement.  Interestingly, the area did not 

experience the housing boom and bust that occurred in much of the nation.  Whereas national 

house prices rose by 89 percent between 2000 and 2006, prices in Oklahoma City rose by only 

35 percent.  In addition, house prices in Oklahoma City have been flat since 2006, a sharp 

contrast to the large drop in national home prices.   

But even though the vacancy rates in Oklahoma City are not a direct result of the housing 

boom and bust, it may be that newer solutions developed for “housing boom” and “low demand” 

areas can be combined with traditional community development policy tools to help solve a 

problem that developed over decades.  Indeed, city planners recently concluded that the city 

could not tackle neighborhood revitalization without addressing vacancies.  Increasing costs for 

needed city services, reduced revenues, and barriers to growth resulting from deteriorating 

infrastructure all combined to lend urgency to these efforts.  As has been the case in other cities, 

officials in Oklahoma City realized that gathering data was a necessary first step.  Starting earlier 

this year, they embarked on an ambitious study to determine the total cost resulting from 

vacancies.  The city will then use the findings from the study to support enactment of tougher 

code enforcement to recover lost revenue, including assessment of fines against owners who fail
