requires that the agencies make public the banks’ ratings and the analysis supporting 

them.  The public nature of CRA evaluations provides a strong incentive for good 

performance as well as a platform for public input on community needs. 

Opportunities for Improvement 

Congress largely left it to the banking agencies to describe in regulations how 

they would evaluate a bank’s CRA performance.  This flexibility is valuable because it 

enables the agencies to revise the implementing regulations from time to time to keep the 

CRA relevant in response to technological innovation and other changes in the landscape 

for banking and community development financing.3       

The agencies have discussed revising the CRA regulations on and off since 2010, 

when interagency hearings were held in several locations across the country.  Last 

August, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued an Advance Notice 

of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to request comments on a variety of questions related 

to defining the areas in which regulators evaluate a bank’s CRA performance, clarifying 

and expanding the types of activities that are eligible for CRA consideration, and 

establishing a metrics-based approach to rating a bank’s CRA performance, among other 

things.  The OCC received nearly 1,500 comment letters in response to the ANPR, and 

we have been reading those letters with great interest.   

To augment this analysis, since October, the Federal Reserve System has held 

more than 25 outreach meetings across the country with banks and community 

                                                 
3 The current regulatory structure dates back to 1995 when the agencies reworked the regulations to provide 
for a variety of evaluation methods for banks of different sizes and business strategies and set out criteria 
by which a bank’s lending, investment, and service activities in its community are evaluated.  There were 
further regulatory revisions in 2005.
