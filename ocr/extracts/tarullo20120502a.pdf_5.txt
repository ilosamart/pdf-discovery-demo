was the problem of credit intermediation partly or wholly outside the limits of the traditional 

banking system.  This so-called shadow banking system involved not only sizeable commercial 

and investment banks, but also a host of smaller firms active across a range of markets and a 

global community of institutional investors. 

To date, the post-crisis regulatory reform program has been substantially directed at the 

too-big-to-fail problem, and more generally at enhancing the resiliency of the largest financial 

firms.  First, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), 

which has the authority to bring within the perimeter of prudential regulation any non-bank 

financial firm whose failure could be the source of systemic problems.  The FSOC has just 

issued a final rule that will guide the process of assessing and designating such firms.  Of course, 

the formerly free-standing investment banks have already been either converted or absorbed into 

bank holding companies.   

Second, the serious shortcomings of pre-crisis capital requirements for banking firms 

have been addressed through several complementary initiatives.  While robust bank capital 

requirements alone cannot ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system, they are 

central to good financial regulation, precisely because they are available to absorb all kinds of 

potential losses, unanticipated as well as anticipated.  With the encouragement and support of the 

U.S. bank regulatory agencies, the Basel Committee has strengthened the traditional, individual-

firm approach to capital requirements:  raising risk-weightings for traded assets, improving the 

quality of loss-absorbing capital through a new minimum common equity ratio standard, creating 

a capital conservation buffer, and introducing an international leverage ratio requirement.  In 

addition, Dodd-Frank codified a requirement for stress testing of the sort already in use by the
