The Key Role of the Emerging Asian Economies 

In light of the various factors weighing on aggregate demand in the United States 

and other advanced economies, I believe it is crucial for emerging market economies, 

particularly in Asia, to take further steps to boost domestic demand, providing support for 

their own growth and that of the global economy.  Indeed, such policies are a core 

component of the G-20 nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. 

Of course, emerging Asia has already made an important contribution to 

bolstering the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis.  The top panel of 

exhibit 3 shows that even though the emerging Asian economies were hit quite hard by 

the global downturn, they recovered much more quickly than did other parts of the world.  

The full extent of the Asian bounceback can perhaps best be appreciated by comparing 

the level of output in Asia, shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, with those in 

advanced economies and other emerging market economies.  Asia’s output level--the 

solid line--has increased substantially from its barely perceptible trough.  Output in other 

emerging market economies--the dashed line--has also increased significantly.  In 

comparison, output in the advanced economies--the dotted line--has not yet attained its 

pre-crisis peak.     

A key factor contributing to the relatively rapid recovery of the Asian emerging 

market economies was that, in contrast to many previous episodes of severe stress, these 

economies were well-positioned to permit the use of countercyclical fiscal and monetary 

policies.  Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balances in emerging Asian economies fell noticeably 

in 2008 and 2009, reflecting a more expansionary fiscal stance; fiscal stimulus was
