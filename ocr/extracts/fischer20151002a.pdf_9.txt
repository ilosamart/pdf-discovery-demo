annual report submitted to the Congress.  In addition, FSOC members jointly identify 

systemically important nonbank financial institutions.  Despite these improvements, it 

remains possible that the FSOC membersâ€™ different mandates, some of which do not 

include macroprudential regulation, may hinder coordination.  By contrast, in the United 

Kingdom, fewer member agencies are represented on the Financial Policy Committee at 

the Bank of England, and each agency has an explicit macroprudential mandate.  The 

committee has a number of tools to carry out this mandate, which currently are sectoral 

capital requirements, the countercyclical capital buffer, and limits on loan-to-value and 

debt-to-income ratios for mortgage lending. 

A second significant challenge to macroprudential policy remains the relative lack 

of measures in the U.S. macroeconomic toolkit to address a cyclical buildup of financial 

stability risks.  Since the crisis, frameworks have been or are currently being developed to 

deploy some countercyclical tools during periods when risks escalate, including the 

analysis of salient risks in annual stress tests for banks, the Basel III countercyclical 

capital buffer, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposal for minimum margins on 

securities financing transactions.  But the FSB proposal is far from being implemented, 

and a number of tools used in other countries are either not available to U.S. regulators or 

very far from being implemented.  For example, several other countries have used tools 

such as time-varying risk weights and time-varying loan-to-value and debt-to-income 

caps on mortgages.  Indeed, international experience points to the usefulness of these
