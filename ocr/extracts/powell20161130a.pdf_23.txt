IS equation relates the unemployment gap to the lagged unemployment
gap and the lagged real interest gap as follows:

(ut+1 − ut+1
* ) = α × (ut − ut

*) + β × (rt − rt
*)

α = 0.86 and β = 0.14

Use median values of the longer−run unemployment rate, the
unemployment rate, and the real federal funds rate from the September
2016 Summary of Economic Projections to solve for the implied
short−run, time−varying r*
