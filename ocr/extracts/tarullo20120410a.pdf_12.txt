course, good modeling -- whether at a firm or at the Federal Reserve -- should be adapted to take 

advantage of improved data and advances in risk management.  It would not be desirable to fix 

upon a model and continue to use it even as it becomes stale and, thus, potentially misleading. 

In this regard, I note that the Dodd-Frank stress testing regime that we will implement 

requires that the bank holding companies themselves disclose the results of their own stress tests.  

This will be a valuable augmentation of the transparency around stress testing, providing markets 

and stakeholders with more information about the risk-management practices of bank holding 

companies and creating points of comparison with the Federal Reserve’s stress testing.  More 

generally, there will be a good deal of continuity as we implement the stress testing requirements 

of the Dodd-Frank Act.  But the statute requires some additional elements, such as using three, 

rather than two, scenarios.  We are currently accepting public comment on our proposed 

regulation implementing this part of Dodd-Frank.   

Conclusion 

 Stress testing and regular capital review exercises have already become key components 

of our supervisory program for large bank holding companies.  Indeed, as I suggested earlier, 

they are critical for ensuring that the increased resilience of the financial system envisioned in 

the post-crisis strengthening of capital requirements is realized.  Furthermore, just as these 

supervisory instruments aim for dynamic assessment of capital needs, so they will remain 

dynamic, adapting in response to our experience, economic and financial conditions, and 

advancements in risk measurement. 

 Having offered an encomium to these tools, let me end by making clear that a one-size-

fits-all approach is no more appropriate here than in most other areas of prudential supervision.  

While forward-looking assessment is important for capital planning in all banking organizations,
