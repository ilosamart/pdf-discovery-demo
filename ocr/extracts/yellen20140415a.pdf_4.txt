on the financial system as a whole.  They only apply to internationally active banks, and 

not directly to shadow banks, despite the fact that liquidity shocks within the shadow 

banking system played a major role in the crisis.  Furthermore, the current versions of the 

LCR and NSFR do not address financial stability risks associated with so-called matched 

books of securities financing transactions.   

Federal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could 

address these and other residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets.  Some 

of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable 

funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding--would 

likely apply only to the largest, most complex banking organizations.  Other measures--

such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities 

financing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply on a marketwide basis.  In 

designing such measures, we are carefully thinking through questions about the tradeoffs 

associated with tighter liquidity regulation that will be discussed at this conference. 

While these cost-benefit questions are difficult to answer with either certainty or 

precision, let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains 

from introducing further reforms to address short-term wholesale funding risks.  In 2010, 

the Basel Committee assessed the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and 

liquidity requirements for global banks.  Factoring in the Basel III capital requirements 

and the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity 

requirements would, on net, provide economic benefits, and that benefits would continue 

to accrue at even higher levels of risk-based capital than are part of Basel III.
