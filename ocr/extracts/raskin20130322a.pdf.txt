Focusing on Low- and Moderate-Income Working Americans 



Remarks by 

Sarah Bloom Raskin 

Member 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

National Community Reinvestment Coalition Annual Conference 

Washington, D.C. 



March 22, 2013 


I am delighted to be here at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 

(NCRC) Annual Conference today, and to be gathered with so many people who have 

been working for decades to strengthen communities and the integrity of our nation’s 

economic institutions and financial practices.  Those of you involved in community 

development and community reinvestment know all too well the trauma and hardship 

experienced by low-income communities over the last several years. You know it in a 

way that is lost on people whose communities have not been so badly battered by these 

economic storms.  That’s why I’m looking forward this morning to sharing with you my 

perspective on the importance of focusing on the situation and prospects of low- and 

moderate-income working Americans. 

In my remarks, I will start by discussing the types of jobs being generated in the 

current recovery.  Certainly, the pace of recovery in employment has improved, but it’s 

important to look at the types of jobs that are being created because those jobs will 

directly affect the fortunes and challenges of households and neighborhoods as well as 

the course of the recovery.  I will then suggest that we think about how the absence of a 

substantial number of new high-paying jobs, when combined with changes in the 

landscape for financial services, affects access generally to affordable, sustainable credit.  

Finally, I will explore some of the monetary, supervisory, and regulatory touchpoints in 

which the situation and prospects of low- and moderate-income working Americans can 

be addressed. 

Challenges Posed by Labor Market Conditions  

The Great Recession stands out for the magnitude of job losses we experienced 

throughout the downturn.  These factors have hit low- and moderate-income Americans

the hardest.  The poverty rate has risen sharply since the onset of the recession, after a 

decade of relative stability, and it now stands at 15 percent--significantly higher than the 

average over the past three decades.1  And those who are fortunate enough to have held 

onto their jobs have seen their hourly compensation barely keep pace with the cost of 

living over the past three years.2    

 While today’s 7.7 percent unemployment rate is a marked improvement from the 

10 percent rate we reached in late 2009, it is still higher than the unemployment rate for 

the 24 years before the Great Recession, a span of time over which the rate averaged 

about 6 percent.  Moreover, the government's current estimate of 12 million unemployed 

does not include nearly a million discouraged workers who say they have given up 

looking for work and 8 million people who say that they are working part time even 

though they would prefer a full-time job.  A broader measure of underemployment that 

includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.3 percent.  

About two-thirds of all job losses resulting from the recession were in moderate-

wage occupations, such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration 

jobs.  However, these occupations have accounted for less than one-quarter of subsequent 

job gains.  The declines in lower-wage occupations--such as retail sales and food service-

-accounted for about one-fifth of job loss, but a bit more than one-half of subsequent job 

gains.  Indeed, recent job gains have been largely concentrated in lower-wage

2 These dynamics have disproportionately hurt the young, the less-educated, and racial and ethnic minorities. The 
unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is 11.2 percent.  Among workers age 16 to 19, the 
unemployment rate is 25.1 percent.  Compared with the 7.7 percent unemployment rate for all workers, the 
unemployment rate among African Americans is 13.8 percent, and 9.6 percent among Latinos.

occupations such as retail sales, food preparation, manual labor, home health care, and 

customer service.3   

Furthermore, wage growth has remained more muted than is typical during an 

economic recovery.  To some extent, the rebound is being driven by the low-paying 

nature of the jobs that have been created.  The slow rebound also reflects the severe 

nature of the crisis, as the slow wage growth especially affects those workers who have 

become recently re-employed following long spells of unemployment.  In fact, while 

average wages have continued to increase steadily for persons who have remained 

employed all along, the average wage for new hires have actually declined since 2010.4   

 The faces of low-wage Americans are diverse.  They include people of varying 

employment status, race, gender, immigration status, and other characteristics.  Many 

such Americans are attached to the workforce and are deeply committed to both personal 

success and to making a contribution to society.  For purposes of reference, in 2011, low 

wage was defined as $23,005 per year or $11.06 per hour.5   

Today, about one-quarter of all workers are considered “low wage.” They are 

sanitation workers, office receptionists, and nursing assistants; they are single mothers of 

three who worry: How will I be able to send my children to college? What if my landlord 

raises the rent this year?  Tens of millions of Americans are the people who ask 

themselves these questions every day.

observed during the recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000’s—the so-called “jobless recoveries”—but not prior 
to then.

working life are especially severe when the job loss occurs during a recession. See Steven J. Davis and Till von

This diverse group of workers faces numerous barriers when trying to access the 

labor market or advance in their current positions.  Many of these barriers were identified 

in an initiative that the Federal Reserve’s Community Development function launched in 

2011.  Over the course of a year, Reserve Banks across the country hosted a series of 32 

regional discussions aimed at examining the complex factors creating chronic 

unemployment conditions and identifying promising workforce development solutions.6  

The kinds of problems faced by low-wage workers are familiar to all of you and have 

long been part of the structural conditions of poverty and near-poverty in America. 

  We know, for example, that location presents thorny challenges for many low-

wage workers.  Within metropolitan areas, jobs are not spread out evenly and job creation 

tends to be depressed in low-income communities.  As a result, many low-wage workers 

face long commutes and serious commuting difficulties due to less reliable transportation 

and an inadequate transportation infrastructure.  Moreover, a number of low-wage 

employees work non-standard hours, exacerbating both transportation and childcare 

issues, as well as personal health problems.7   

Traditionally, many workers find jobs through social networks and through 

personal connections that they have to the labor market.  But, because low-income 

individuals are typically less mobile, more isolated, and less socially connected than other 

people, they are often left out of the social networks that, in practice, lead to jobs for most 

Americans.

Addressing These Challenges 

Among those responding to these challenges are innovative local practitioners 

who are implementing programs designed to expand job opportunities for low-wage 

workers.  Consider Impact Services in Philadelphia, an organization that builds 

relationships with the local business community to better understand their hiring needs 

and then devises programs that supply those firms with appropriately skilled workers 

from the community.8   The National Fund for Workforce Solutions is another example.  

This organization works with local communities to organize funding collaboratives to 

support regional industries.9  

More Recent Challenges for Low-Wage Workers 

So progress is being made, thanks to coalitions like these across the country that 

are working for practical changes at the community level.  But the 21st century labor 

market is increasingly complex; it continues to generate new challenges. For example, 

growth in sectors such as green industries and advanced manufacturing is creating jobs, 

but these jobs may demand different skills.  Access to reliable information becomes 

critical for workers who are considering a new job, and must carefully weigh the skills 

and credentials required by potential employers with the cost of training and the 

likelihood of gaining employment.  

 And, more and more, employers are requiring post-secondary credentials.  

Today, a high school diploma alone is less likely to qualify an individual for a job with a

9 One of the National Fund’s collaboratives is the Southwest Alabama Workforce Development Council (SAWDC).  
This collaborative is working to address a local skills gap by creating a comprehensive workforce development system 
for the region.  This system includes formal feedback from the business community to the educational system about 
skills that are in high demand.  Educators then develop a curriculum that prepares students to access the local job 
market.  During the National Fund’s first five years of existence, it worked with more than 3,000 employers to serve 
more than 42,000 job seekers and workers across 32 communities. For more information about the National Fund for 
Workforce Solutions, go to www.nfwsolutions.org.

path toward meaningful advancement.  And, as demand for more credentials increases, 

workers who lack those credentials will find it increasingly difficult to gain upward 

mobility in the job market.  

Contingent Work 

Many employers are looking to make the employment relationship more flexible, 

and so are increasingly relying on part-time work and a variety of arrangements popularly 

known as "contingent work."  This trend toward a more flexible workforce will likely 

continue.  For example, while temporary work accounted for 10 percent of job losses 

during the recession, these jobs have accounted for more than 25 percent of net 

employment gains since the recession ended.10 In fact, temporary help is rapidly 

approaching a new record, and businesses’ use of staffing services continues to 

increase.11 

Contingent employment is arguably a sensible response to today's competitive 

marketplace.  Contingent arrangements allow firms to maximize workforce flexibility in 

the face of seasonal and cyclical forces.  The flexibility may be beneficial for workers 

who want or need time to address their family needs.  However, workers in these jobs 

often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional full-time or "permanent"

From the Current Employment Statistics Survey (National),” August 4. 
11 In a 2011 McKinsey Global Institute U.S. Jobs Survey of 2,000 employers of all sizes and in all sectors, 34 percent 
of employers indicated that they expect their companies to increase temporary and contract workers over the next five 
years.  See James Manyika, Susan Lund, Byron Auguste, Lenny Mendonca, Tim Welsh, and Sreenivas Ramaswamy

workers, are much less likely to benefit from the protections of labor and employment 

laws, and often have no real pathway to upward mobility in the workplace.12   

Many workers who hold contingent positions do so involuntarily.   Department of 

Labor statistics tell us that 8 million Americans say they are working part-time jobs but 

would like full-time jobs.13  These are the people in our communities who are “part time 

by necessity.”  As businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-

time, temporary, and seasonal positions, workers today bear far more of the responsibility 

and risk for managing their careers and financial security.  Indeed, the expansion of 

contingent work has contributed to the increasing gap between high- and low-wage 

workers and to the increasing sense of insecurity among workers.14 

Flexible and part-time arrangements can present great opportunities to some 

workers, but the substantial increase in part-time workers does raise a number of 

concerns.  Part-time workers are particularly vulnerable to personal shocks due to lower 

levels of compensation, the absence of meaningful benefits, and even a lack of paid sick 

or personal days.   Not surprisingly, turnover is high in these part-time jobs.    

Access to Credit 

The economic marginalization that comes with the growth of part-time and low-

paying jobs is exacerbated by inadequate access to credit for many working Americans.  

Ideally, people chronically short of cash would have access to safe and sound financial 

institutions that could provide reliable and affordable access to credit as well as good 

savings plans.  Unfortunately, many working Americans have no practical access to

reasonably priced financial products with safe features, much less the kind of safe and 

fair credit that is available to wealthier consumers.  

Working Americans have several core financial needs.  They need a safe, 

accessible, and affordable method to deposit or cash checks, receive deposits, pay bills, 

and accrue savings.  They may also need access to credit to tide them over until their next 

cash infusion arrives.  They may be coming up short on paying their rent, their mortgage, 

an emergency medical expense, or an unexpected car repair.  They may want access to a 

savings vehicle that, down the road, will help them pay for these items and for education 

or further training, or start a business.  And many want some form of non-cash payment 

method to conduct transactions that are difficult or impossible to conduct using cash.   

Products and services that serve these core financial needs are not consistently 

available at competitive rates to working Americans.  Those with low and moderate 

incomes may have insufficient income or assets to meet the relatively high requirements 

needed to establish a credit history.  Others may have problems in their credit history that 

inhibit their ability to borrow on competitive terms.   

Many workers simply may not have banks in their communities, or may not have 

access to banks that actually compete with each other in terms of pricing or customer 

service.  There is a growing trend toward greater concentration of financial assets at 

fewer banks. In my mind, this raises doubts about whether banking services will continue 

to be provided at competitive rates to all income levels of customers wherever they may 

live. 

According to a study of bank branch locations published by NCRC in 2007, there 

are more persons per branch in low- and moderate-income census tracts than in 


 - 9 -

moderate- and upper-income census tracts.  While branch-building has been on the rise, 

indications are that the increase in the number of bank offices has not occurred evenly 

across neighborhoods of varying income.15 

  In fact, a significant number of low- and moderate-income families have 

become--or are at risk of becoming--financially marginalized.  The percentage of families 

earning $15,000 per year or less who reported that they have no bank account increased 

between 2007 and 2009 such that more than one in four families was unbanked.   

Families slightly further up the income distribution, earning between $25,000 and 

$30,000 per year, are also financially marginalized: 13 percent report being unbanked and 

almost 24 percent report being underbanked.16  

This combination of economic insecurity and financial marginalization has 

incentivized more low- and moderate-income families to seek out alternative financial 

service providers to meet their financial needs.  Some of the providers they find, such as 

check-cashers and outfits furnishing advance loans on paychecks, can lead unwary 

workers into very deep financial holes.    

  In light of these challenges, I ask questions that have been asked before:  What 

can economic policy do to reduce unemployment, economic marginalization, and the 

financial vulnerability of millions of lower-income working Americans?  There is no 

simple cure to these conditions, but government policymakers need to focus seriously on

the problems, not simply because of notions of fairness and justice, but because the 

economy’s ability to produce a stable quality of living for millions of people is at stake.  

Our country cannot achieve prosperity without addressing the powerful undertow created 

by flat wages and tenuous financial security for so many millions of Americans. 

The Role of Monetary Policy 

So how can the Federal Reserve address these challenges?  Let me start with 

monetary policy.  Congress has directed the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to 

promote maximum employment and price stability.  The Federal Reserve’s primary 

monetary policy tool is its ability to influence the level of interest rates.  Federal Reserve 

policymakers pushed short-term interest rates down nearly to zero as the financial crisis 

spread and the recession worsened in 2007 and 2008.  By late 2008, it was clear that still 

more policy stimulus was necessary to turn the recession around.  The Federal Reserve 

could not push short-term interest rates down further, but it could--and did--use the 

unconventional policy tools to bring longer-term interest rates such as mortgage rates 

down further.   

Fed policymakers intend to keep interest rates low for a considerable time to 

promote a stronger economic recovery, a substantial improvement in labor market 

conditions, and greater progress toward maximum employment in a context of price 

stability.  Both anecdotal evidence and a wide range of economic indicators show that 

these attempts are working to strengthen the recovery and that the labor market is 

improving.   

Nonetheless, and again, the millions of people who would prefer to work full time 

can find only part-time work.  While the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tools can be 


 - 11 -

effective in promoting stronger economic recovery and job gains, they have little effect 

on the types of jobs that are created, particularly over the longer term.  So, while 

monetary policy can help, it does not address all of the challenges that low- and 

moderate-income workers are confronting.  That said, the existing mandate regarding 

maximum employment requires policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) to understand labor market dynamics, which obviously must include an 

understanding of low- and moderate-income workers. 

Regulatory and Supervisory Touchpoints 

In addition to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory 

policies have the potential to address some of the challenges faced by low-income 

communities and consumers.  The Federal Reserve is required by law--by virtue of the 

Bank Holding Company Act--to approve various applications, such as mergers, 

acquisitions, and proposals to conduct new activities.  This statutory review requires an 

explicit consideration of public benefits and the effects of the proposed transaction on the 

convenience and needs of the communities to be served.  This assessment is, as many of 

you know, a critical opportunity for community input and analysis. 

Indeed, as people with their feet firmly planted on the ground in communities 

across America, you probably remember James Q. Wilson’s theory of “broken windows” 

in community policing:  Move in quickly when vandalism and disorder first start to 

appear--even if it is only a broken window or graffiti on a stop sign--or else face losing 

the whole neighborhood as disrespect for the law rapidly spreads.17  

                                                       
17 See George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson (1982), “Broken Windows: The police and neighborhood safety”, The 
Atlantic, March 1, www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465. 


 - 12 -

The “broken windows” strategy is every bit as compelling when it comes to 

addressing the disorder that comes from sloppy practices by financial institutions.  If 

banking practices are undermining the ability of the economically marginalized to 

become financially included and to access the credit they need in an affordable way, 

regulators must move in quickly to stop the disorder and repair the broken windows of 

financial intermediation.    

Bank supervisors should be prepared to respond to the earliest signs of trouble by 

requiring operationally challenged banks to address problems quickly and completely.   If 

corrections are made, then the regulators can move on.  If not, then the regulators need to 

escalate enforcement. 

Swift and decisive corrective action is not always how federal bank regulators 

have responded to broken windows in the past.   In my view, for example, regulators’ 

response to the rampant, long-running problems in loan-servicing practices at large 

financial institutions was not swift and was not decisive.  The point is that federal 

regulators must listen carefully to community input and analysis in order to keep track of 

where windows are breaking and how they are being broken.  And they must carefully 

study and take responsibility for analyzing comments provided by organizations such as 

the NCRC when considering the public benefit of an application.  Both the exam process 

and the application process must be strengthened as key venues for federal regulators to 

incorporate the voices of affected communities; I'd like to see us revise and strengthen 

these processes to include the analysis in these voices.

The Role of Business 

Now let’s shift back to the private sector. In particular, to the question of whether 

businesses can be competitive in the current marketplace and still provide a pathway out 

of poverty for their employees.  The Hitachi Foundation recently set out to answer this 

question by identifying firms that provided upward job mobility for their employees.  

They found that the identified employers showed noteworthy consistency in how they 

train and educate workers, develop career ladders, and craft supportive human resources 

policies and other motivators.  They also found some evidence to indicate that the 

companies benefited from strategic and financial returns while their lower-wage workers 

also benefited from increased earnings and career advancement.18,19 

“Anchor institutions,” such as hospitals and universities, which are firmly rooted 

in their locales, can also be powerful engines for job creation in their communities. 

Anchors may include cultural institutions, health care facilities, community foundations, 

faith-based institutions, public utilities, and municipal governments.  These institutions 

have the potential to generate local jobs through targeted procurement purchases of food, 

                                                       
18 For  more information about The Hitachi Foundation, go to www.hitachifoundation.org/index.php. 
19 While the common perception may be that businesses do not invest in employee training, a survey by the American 
Society for Training and Development indicated that employers committed $172 billion in 2011 to employee training.  
See American Society for Training and Development (2011), “2011 State of the Industry Report Shows Increased 
Spending, Commitment for L&D,” December 20, www.astd.org/Publications/Blogs/ASTD-Blog/2011/12/2011-State-
of-the-Industry-report-Shows-Increased-Spending-Commitment-for-LD. This investment, however, traditionally funds 
the highest-educated and highest-paid employees. The Hitachi Foundation has suggested that considering a reallocation 
of even a small portion of these funds toward frontline workers would offer benefits to both employers and employees.  
As an example of these employer practices, right here in our backyard, the Community Foundation for the National 
Capital Region piloted the “Career Navigators” program with three hospitals in Maryland’s Montgomery County and 
one in the District of Columbia to help employees navigate a pathway to better jobs with their current employer.  These 
hospitals concluded that investing in training and education for top-performing, entry-level staffers in positions such as 
housekeeping, food service, and patient transport could provide a pipeline for the skilled employees that the hospitals 
would rely upon in the future.  Employees receive support with literacy and college-readiness training, career coaching, 
and scholarships.  The program also helps hospitals document internal career pathways and train the human resource 
staff to serve as career coaches.  Throughout these efforts, the participating hospitals have reported enhanced employee 
engagement, reduced errors, and improved performance.

energy, supplies, and services from local businesses. This can be a substantial, positive 

development in the local economy. 20 

The Evergreen Cooperative in Cleveland, Ohio, is an example of a network of 

worker-owned businesses, launched in low-income neighborhoods, to support local 

anchor institutions.  The cooperatives were initially established to provide services to 

local hospitals and universities that had agreed to make their purchases locally.  This 

model is effective because it capitalizes on local production, and because it forges a local 

business development strategy that effectively meets many of the anchor institutions’ 

own needs.21 

Role for Community-Based Organizations 

Clearly, the challenges facing low-wage workers are multi-faceted and complex.  

In addition to the challenges that workforce development and community organizations 

have addressed for years, structural changes in the economy heighten obstacles, make the 

stakes higher if we fail to conquer them, and, therefore, require new levels of openness 

and creativity by policymakers.  You are the ideal audience for this message because you 

know how to link federal policymaking with economic empowerment. 

NCRC has grown to an association of more than 600 community-based 

organizations that promote access to basic banking services to create and sustain 

affordable housing, jobs, and vibrant communities for America's working families.  

Community-based organizations like many of those represented in this room will need to

consider how to work with low-wage workers to bridge information gaps by expanding 

workers’ networks, providing legitimate information, and identifying new job 

opportunities.    

But finally, the pressure that community-based organizations exert on financial 

regulators must continue.  Access to credit is an enduring challenge, and the obstacles 

and problems--all the “broken windows” you see on the block--must be reported and 

explained.  They must be understood by the federal policymakers who are responsible for 

enforcing our country’s laws and regulations in the realm of access to credit; by the 

federal policymakers who engage in the conduct of monetary policy; and by the federal 

policymakers whose actions contribute to the shaping of the landscape for financial 

services in this country.  Your voices--whether you are reporting, documenting, 

monitoring, analyzing, proposing, or even protesting--must be heard. Your voices are 

crucial to alerting policymakers to the significant developments and emerging trends in 

the nation’s communities that must be confronted--and confronted in a swift and decisive 

way--if we are to make prosperity a national agenda that touches every American.    

Thank you.
