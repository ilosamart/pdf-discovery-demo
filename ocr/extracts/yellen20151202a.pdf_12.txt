As you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal 

funds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at its effective lower 

bound.  We have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect 

that decision.  Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary 

policy will remain accommodative.  And it bears emphasizing that what matters for the 

economic outlook are the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds 

rate over time:  It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby 

influence spending and investment decisions.  In this regard, the Committee anticipates 

that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic 

conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels 

the Committee views as normal in the longer run.   

This expectation is consistent with an implicit assessment that the neutral nominal 

federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither 

expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential--is 

currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time.  One 

indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has 

been quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and 

the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities.  Had the neutral rate 

been running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial 

crisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid 

economic expansion, with inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent 

objective.
