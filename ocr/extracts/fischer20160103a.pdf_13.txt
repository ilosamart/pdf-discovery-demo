financial stability objectives call for the same policy action--for example, when the credit 

cycle is approaching its peak, output is above potential, and inflation pressures appear to 

be building.  In contrast, when different objectives call for different policy actions--for 

example, when some financial assets appear overvalued but economic growth remains 

tepid and inflation is subdued--policymakers may find this tradeoff much more difficult 

to assess and will search for macroprudential tools.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, recent 

contributions in the literature that quantify this tradeoff point to a range of 

recommendations, with some reporting an optimal monetary policy that leans against the 

wind and some suggesting otherwise.20

I would like to conclude on this issue by saying that the issue is a bit more 

complicated than suggested so far--for, given that financial variables are a critical part of 

the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, when policymakers say the economy is 

overheating, they may well be considering the behavior of asset prices as a critical part of 

that phenomenon and part of the reason to tighten monetary policy.  Thus, I believe that 

the real issue of whether adjustments in interest rates should be used to deal with 

problems of potential financial instability is macroeconomic, and that if asset prices 

across the economy--that is, taking all financial markets into account--are thought to be 

excessively high, raising the interest rate may be the appropriate step.  Further discussion 

of this issue will probably bear considerable similarity to the analysis of how to deal with 

20 This variability is in part due to different model set-ups, such as how financial instability builds up and 
how it affects economic outcomes.  For example, Woodford (2012) finds that leaning against the wind does 
not change the basis for traditional stabilization objectives in a standard New Keynesian model, whereas 
the cost-benefit analysis in Svensson (2015) finds little basis for the “leaning against the wind” strategy.  
Ajello and others (2015) find that optimal adjustment of the policy rate, when the possibility of a crisis is 
taken into account, is small unless the policymaker is assumed to be quite uncertain about the likelihood 
and severity of the crisis.
