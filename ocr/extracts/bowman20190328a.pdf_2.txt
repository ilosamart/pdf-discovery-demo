Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the important role 

agriculture plays in our economy, a role that is supported by many community banks.  I 

would like to thank the Independent Community Bankers Association and their New 

Mexico state association for inviting me to participate in the conversation we will have 

today.  In addition to the bankers and state leaders here, agricultural bankers and other 

leaders in the industry are listening in from around the country, and I look forward to 

hearing their views in a few moments.   

During our time together, I would like to offer some observations on the current 

state of the farm economy.  And because I see community bankers as playing a vital role 

in this sector, I’ll explain why I believe the community banking model is well-suited to 

supporting agricultural businesses.  Finally, I will highlight the Federal Reserve’s 

approach to supervising agricultural banks.   

As many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I worked at a 

community bank that primarily served ranchers and farmers and the businesses that 

support them.  More recently, as Kansas state bank commissioner, I supervised many 

banks whose business and customers were closely connected to the land and the people 

who work it.  I now have the honor of being the first governor to fill the role designated 

for someone with community banking experience on the Federal Reserve Board, a 

position that was created by statute in 2015.1  I plan to fulfill this unique responsibility by 

traveling widely and listening closely to community bankers, consumers, farmers, 

ranchers, and dairy farmers--all of the stakeholders with an interest in our work.  My goal 

is to bring back the knowledge I gain from discussions and visits like the one we are
