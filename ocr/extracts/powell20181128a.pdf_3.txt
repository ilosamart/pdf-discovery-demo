gradually toward levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.  Interest rates are still 

low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of 

the level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing 

down growth.  My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private-sector economists, 

are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent.   

There is a great deal to like about this outlook.  But we know that things often 

turn out to be quite different from even the most careful forecasts.  For this reason, sound 

policymaking is as much about managing risks as it is about responding to the baseline 

forecast.  Our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing 

risks.  We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion.  We also know 

that moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long--could risk other 

distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  Our path 

of gradual increases has been designed to balance these two risks, both of which we must 

take seriously.   

We also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are 

uncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized.  While FOMC participants’ 

projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy 

path.  We will be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial 

data are telling us.  As always, our decisions on monetary policy will be designed to keep 

the economy on track in light of the changing outlook for jobs and inflation.   

Under the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the Fed’s meat and potatoes.  In 

the rest of my comments, I will focus on financial stability--a topic that has always been 

on the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.
