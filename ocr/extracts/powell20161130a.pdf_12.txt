projections from the September SEP in this exercise.  The IS specification employed here 

is similar to that used in Laubach-Williams (2003) and is shown in figure 8.22  Using 

these short-run, time-varying estimates of r* as intercepts in our Taylor rule gives us the 

purple dashed-dotted line in figure 9.  This rule now tells us that the median dot remains 

slightly below the adjusted rule’s prescription at the end of 2016 and 2017 but is back in 

line by the end of 2018. 

As Don Kohn recently noted, “We have been in uncharted waters with unreliable 

anchors.”23  The downward march of the dots shows that policymakers have been 

learning, and our understanding of the economy has been evolving, as we navigate the 

treacherous shoals of the post-crisis economy.  The revisions in the longer-run values and 

the short-run, time-varying r* estimates provide a framework for understanding 

policymakers’ evolving views of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.  And 

the dots for 2016 and 2017 lie below the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 9, showing 

that FOMC participants see an even more gradual path of rate increases than suggested 

by the short-run r* estimates.  This lower path may be related to global economic 

weakness and risk-management considerations at the effective lower bound.  Of course, 

all of this would have happened in the absence of an SEP or a dot plot.  The new
