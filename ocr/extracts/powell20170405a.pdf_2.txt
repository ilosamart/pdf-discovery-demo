Thank you, Donna.  Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve.  We are 

honored to have you here today as we host the biennial Interagency Minority Depository 

Institution (MDI) and Community Development Financial Institution Bank Conference.  

My colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and I are especially 

honored to be hosting you in Los Angeles.  As you probably know, all of the previous 

Interagency MDI conferences have been held on the East Coast, mainly in Washington, 

D.C.  However, because the largest concentration of minority banks is located here in 

Southern California, it seemed natural to bring this conference west.   

The Federal Reserve seeks to support MDIs in a number of ways, including our 

Partnership for Progress, our program for outreach and technical assistance to MDIs.  

Both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation share our goal of preserving and promoting MDIs because you are critical 

institutions to the communities you serve and the larger U.S. economy.  And I note that 

Congress has also recognized your importance, mandating our respective agencies to help 

support MDIs. From the perspective of someone who sits on the Federal Open Market 

Committee, I see many ways that the Federal Reserve can not only support MDIs but is 

itself also supported by them, and I would like to talk about four of these ways today.   

First, half of our monetary policy mandate is maximum sustainable employment.  

That means that we need to be aware of employment trends across all communities in 

America, not just the top-line averages, since unemployment rates vary significantly 

across races and geographies.  For the first time, last year, we put into our Monetary 

Policy Report to Congress a section that detailed how post-recession economic gains
