succeed in any job.  One of the original groceries financed under the program has also 

added in-store financial services and a health clinic.  As this grocery operator discovered, 

access to healthcare is another critical need in many low-income communities.   

In Chicago, residents have taken it upon themselves to fill the need for primary 

and specialty healthcare by establishing the Lawndale Christian Health Center.  

Ownership in the Center is retained by residents to ensure that it continues to meet the 

needs of its neighborhood.  In another example of a community facility meeting more 

than one need, the Center has expanded over time to provide leadership development and 

organizational capacity building services to its members in addition to health services. 

Conclusion  

I could go on to recite more examples of programs that respond to community 

needs, but I think you get my point:  Taking an entrepreneurial approach to community 

development results in innovative and effective programs, making communities more 

desirable places to live and more resilient in hard times.  The CRA regulations encourage 

banks and thrifts to invest in activities that provide affordable housing or financial 

services for individuals, promote economic development, or revitalize or stabilize low- or 

moderate-income areas.   

At a time when the needs of these communities are so great and the resources 

available to meet those needs are so scarce, it behooves financial institutions to think 

broadly about their CRA obligations.  By partnering with other community stakeholders, 

these institutions can help address existing community needs and lay the groundwork for 

stronger credit demand in the future.
