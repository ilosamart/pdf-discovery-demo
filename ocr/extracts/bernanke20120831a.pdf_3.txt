The Committee held rates constant over the summer as it monitored economic and 

financial conditions.  When the crisis intensified markedly in the fall, the Committee 

responded by cutting the target for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in October, 

with half of this easing coming as part of an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut 

by six major central banks.  Then, in December 2008, as evidence of a dramatic 

slowdown mounted, the Committee reduced its target to a range of 0 to 25 basis points, 

effectively its lower bound.  That target range remains in place today.  

Despite the easing of monetary policy, dysfunction in credit markets continued to 

worsen.  As you know, in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve took 

extraordinary steps to provide liquidity and support credit market functioning, including 

the establishment of a number of emergency lending facilities and the creation or 

extension of currency swap agreements with 14 central banks around the world.2  In its 

role as banking regulator, the Federal Reserve also led stress tests of the largest U.S. bank 

holding companies, setting the stage for the companies to raise capital.  These actions--

along with a host of interventions by other policymakers in the United States and 

throughout the world--helped stabilize global financial markets, which in turn served to 

check the deterioration in the real economy and the emergence of deflationary pressures.   

Unfortunately, although it is likely that even worse outcomes had been averted, 

the damage to the economy was severe.  The unemployment rate in the United States rose 

from about 6 percent in September 2008 to nearly 9 percent by April 2009--it would peak 

at 10 percent in October--while inflation declined sharply.  As the crisis crested, and with
