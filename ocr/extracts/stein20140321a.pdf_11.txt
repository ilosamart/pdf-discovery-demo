Okay.  So let’s stipulate that risk premiums in the bond market move around a lot.  

The next observation to throw into the mix is that monetary policy is one of the factors 

that have an important influence on these movements.  An emerging body of empirical 

work finds that an easing of monetary policy--even via conventional policy tools in 

normal times--tends to reduce both the term premiums on long-term Treasury securities 

and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.17  That is, monetary policy always tends to 

work in part through its effect on capital market risk premiums, perhaps through a risk-

taking or reaching-for-yield mechanism.18   

However, while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light on how 

monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that there is 

any financial stability dark side--that is, any meaningful increase in what I have been 

calling FMV--to the lowered risk premiums that go with monetary accommodation.  For 

there to be such a dark side, there would have to be some sort of asymmetry in the 

unwinding of the effects of monetary policy on these risk premiums, whereby the 

eventual reversal either happens more abruptly, or causes larger economic effects, than 

the initial compression.   

Let’s take an example.  Suppose that initially, the credit risk premium on high-

yield bonds is 400 basis points, and that, because the unemployment rate is well above 
                                                                                                                                                 
my intuition is that the source of variation may matter quite a bit.  For example, I would conjecture that it 
might be more normatively appropriate, holding fixed the consequences for aggregate activity and 
unemployment, to lean against a sharp reduction in risk premiums that is driven by investor sentiment 
rather than against one that is driven by a rational response to changes in the risk environment. 
17 See, for example, Hanson and Stein (2012); Gertler and Karadi (2013); and Gilchrist, Lopez-Salido, and 
Zakrajsek (2014). 
18 Note that, as an econometric matter, it is easier to establish a causal effect of monetary policy on risk 
premiums than on broad measures of leverage, because asset prices can be measured on a daily or even 
intraday basis.  So they can be directly related to innovations in the stance of policy, as proxied for by, for 
example, movements in short-term rates in the wake of an announcement by the Federal Open Market 
Committee.  A similar identification strategy is not available for linking monetary policy changes to 
movements in, say, nonfinancial-sector leverage, given that the latter is measured infrequently.
