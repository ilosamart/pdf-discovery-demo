tax hit and choose to remain large, while B and C, with more modest scale economies, would be 

expected to shrink more radically.  In other words, price-based regulation is more flexible, in that 

it leaves the size decision to bank managers, who can then base their decision on their own 

understanding of the synergies--or lack thereof--in their respective businesses.  

 This logic can be thought of as supporting the approach taken by the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision in its rule imposing a common equity surcharge on designated global 

systemically important banks.  The exact amount of the surcharge will range from 1 percent to 

2.5 percent, and will depend on factors that include a bank’s size, complexity, and 

interconnectedness, as measured by a variety of indicator variables.

  These progressive 

surcharges are effectively a type of price-based regulation, and therefore should have the 

advantages I just noted.   

However, a proponent of size caps might reasonably reply:  “Fine, but how do I know 

that these surcharges are actually enough to change behavior--that is, to exert a meaningful 

influence on the size distribution of the banking system?”  After all, the analogy between a 

capital requirement and a tax is somewhat imperfect, since we don’t know exactly the implicit 

tax rate associated with a given level of capital.  Some view capital requirements as quite 

burdensome, which would mean that even a 2 percent surcharge amounts to a significant tax and, 

hence, a strong incentive for a bank to shrink, while others have argued that capital requirements 

impose only modest costs, which would imply little incentive to shrink.

This uncertainty about the ultimate effect of a given capital-surcharge regime on the size 

distribution of banks could potentially tip the balance back in favor of quantity-based regulation,
