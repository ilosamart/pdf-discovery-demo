Headwinds Affecting the Recovery 

What are the headwinds that have slowed the return of our economy to full 

employment?  Some have come from the housing sector.  Previous recoveries have often 

been associated with a vigorous rebound in housing, as rising incomes and confidence 

and, often, a decline in mortgage interest rates led to sharp increases in the demand for 

homes.7  But the housing bubble and its aftermath have made this episode quite different.  

In the first half of the past decade, both housing prices and construction rose to what 

proved to be unsustainable levels, leading to a subsequent collapse:  House prices 

declined almost one-third nationally from 2006 until early this year, construction of 

single-family homes fell two-thirds, and the number of construction jobs decreased by 

nearly one-third.  And, of course, the associated surge in delinquencies on mortgages 

helped trigger the broader financial crisis. 

Recently, the housing market has shown some clear signs of improvement, as 

home sales, prices, and construction have all moved up since early this year.  These 

developments are encouraging, and it seems likely that, on net, residential investment 

will be a source of economic growth and new jobs over the next couple of years.  

However, while historically low mortgage interest rates and the drop in home prices have 

made housing exceptionally affordable, a number of factors continue to prevent the sort 

of powerful housing recovery that has typically occurred in the past.  Notably, lenders 

                                                 
7 In the recoveries following the 1975 and 1982 recessions, for example, residential construction directly 
contributed about 1 percentage point to GDP growth during the two years following the recession trough; 
indirect effects--through the effect of home prices on consumer spending or through multiplier effects--no 
doubt added to the contribution.
