implying that the dollar’s decline can explain, at most, only a small part of the rise in oil 

and other commodity prices; indeed, commodity prices have risen dramatically when 

measured in terms of any of the world’s major currencies, not just the dollar.  But even 

this calculation overstates the role of monetary policy, as many factors other than 

monetary policy affect the value of the dollar.  For example, the decline in the dollar 

since February 2009 that I just noted followed a comparable increase in the dollar, which 

largely reflected flight-to-safety flows triggered by the financial crisis in the latter half of 

2008; the dollar’s decline since then in substantial part reflects the reversal of those flows 

as the crisis eased.  Slow growth in the United States and a persistent trade deficit are 

additional, more fundamental sources of recent declines in the dollar’s value; in 

particular, as the United States is a major oil importer, any geopolitical or other shock 

that increases the global price of oil will worsen our trade balance and economic outlook, 

which tends to depress the dollar.  In this case, the direction of causality runs from 

commodity prices to the dollar rather than the other way around.  The best way for the 

Federal Reserve to support the fundamental value of the dollar in the medium term is to 

pursue our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and we will 

certainly do that.  

Another argument that has been made is that low interest rates have pushed up 

commodity prices by reducing the cost of holding inventories, thus boosting commodity 

demand, or by encouraging speculators to push commodity futures prices above their 

fundamental levels.  In either case, if such forces were driving commodity prices 

materially and persistently higher, we should see corresponding increases in commodity 

inventories, as higher prices curtailed consumption and boosted production relative to
