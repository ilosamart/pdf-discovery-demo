The distinction between current and forecast values does not always matter much, 

as (for example) high levels of inflation or output today may signal high levels of those 

variables in the future.  However, over the past decade, the distinction between current 

and forecast inflation has been an important one.  On several occasions during this 

period, surges in energy prices led to increases in overall inflation.  According to the 

standard Taylor rule, whose policy prescription depends on the current value of inflation, 

these episodes should have led to a significant tightening of monetary policy.  However, 

both the FOMC and private forecasters expected these increases in energy prices to 

subside--correctly, as it turned out--and therefore did not much adjust their medium-term 

forecasts for inflation.  Consequently, policy was not tightened as much as would have 

been called for by the standard Taylor rule.  Put another way, the standard Taylor rule 

makes no distinction between increases in inflation expected to be temporary and those 

expected to be longer lasting.  In practice, however, policymakers have responded less to 

increases in inflation that they expect to be temporary, a reasonable strategy given that 

monetary policy affects inflation only with a significant lag. 

Slide 4 shows the quantitative implications of this point.  The actual paths of the 

policy rate, in blue, and the policy prescription implied by the standard Taylor rule, the 

dashed red line, are the same as in Slide 3.  Also shown, as a dotted green line, is the 

monetary policy path prescribed by an alternative version of the Taylor rule that replaces 

the current rate of inflation on the right-hand side with a forecast of inflation over the 

current and subsequent three quarters.  Forecasts are those that were actually made in real 

time, that is, at the time at which the corresponding policy rate was chosen.  For the 

period through 2004, these forecasts are the staff forecasts (the so-called Greenbook
