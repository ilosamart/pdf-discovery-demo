tend to reverberate quickly back to the United States, including through changes in asset 

prices and risk tolerance.  The pronounced tightening of U.S. financial conditions during 

the euro-area sovereign debt crisis that occurred from 2011 to 2012 illustrated the 

strength of these financial ties.  

During the past couple of years, foreign developments have at times been a 

substantial headwind for the U.S. economy.  Although financial conditions have 

improved markedly in the advanced foreign economies and their monetary policy has 

been highly accommodative, these economies have yet to break out from the tepid growth 

they have experienced since the global financial crisis.  Growth in the emerging market 

economies has also been disappointingly slow.  For example, gross domestic product 

(GDP) growth in Latin America declined to zero last year, far below the 3 to 4 percent 

growth rates achieved in the first few years of this decade.2  The emerging market 

economies (EMEs) have weathered several bouts of financial market turbulence, 

including earlier this year, due to market concerns about economic growth in China and 

about its exchange rate system.  With foreign growth relatively weak, the prospect of a 

gradual normalization of U.S. monetary policy contributed to a large appreciation of the 

dollar since mid-2014, with the real effective exchange value of the dollar rising around 

17 percent.   

 These global developments materially slowed progress toward the Federal 

Reserveâ€™s employment and inflation objectives.  The sizable appreciation of the dollar 

has been a substantial drag on U.S. exports over the past two years, and hence subtracted 

from economic growth.  The stronger dollar, in concert with lower oil and other
