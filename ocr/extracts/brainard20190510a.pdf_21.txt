also a factor, along with the ongoing effects of globalization and offshoring.  Earnings 

have declined as the job market has shifted away from important middle-income 

occupations.  Manufacturing, for example, employs vastly fewer people now than it has 

historically.45  It is important to understand the relative importance of these different 

drivers, as they have different implications for the overall health of the economy and for 

policies to support middle-income families.   

Monetary policy aims to influence employment and inflation over the business 

cycle, as opposed to addressing these longer-run structural changes.  But the distribution 

of income and wealth may have important implications for macroeconomic 

developments, such as the evolution of consumption, which is the single biggest engine 

of growth in our economy.  That is why the Federal Reserve has a significant interest in 

understanding distributional developments and their implications.   

Recent research finds that households with lower levels of wealth spend a larger 

fraction of any income gains than households with higher levels of wealth.46  

Consequently, an economy that delivers an increasing share of income gains to high-

wealth households could result in less growth in consumer demand than one in which the 

gains are distributed more equally.  In fact, the recovery of consumer spending after the 

Great Recession was slower than the recovery in aggregate household income and net
