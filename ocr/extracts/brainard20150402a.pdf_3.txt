slashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th month in a row of job cuts.  For young people, 

job prospects were even bleaker.  Nearly one-fourth of teenagers in the labor force were 

unemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood 

at 15.2 percent.  Young African Americans and Hispanics experienced higher rates of 

unemployment than their white peers. 

Even these painfully high unemployment rates--the highest since the early 1980s--

understate the damage caused by the Great Recession to young people’s work lives.  The 

lack of job opportunities appears to have caused many young people to become so 

discouraged that they dropped out of the labor force altogether, exacerbating a downtrend 

and driving labor force participation among young people to historical lows.   

Even for those who remained in the labor force and have been fortunate to find 

work, compensation prospects have been poor.  For example, inflation-adjusted full-time 

weekly earnings among 19- to 24-year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about 

5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1   

Of those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low 

wages, but also many are working at jobs for which they are overqualified.  A recent 

study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that employers responded to the 

slack labor market by increasing the educational requirements or the number of years of 

experience required for new hires, which likely froze out many from the labor pool and
