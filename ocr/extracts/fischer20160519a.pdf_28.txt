Paul Samuelson on Wicksell

“Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and contemporaries, and 

acknowledged the fact; because he was eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas 

as merely tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics after Jevons, 

Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B. Clark – for all these reasons Wicksell

is sometimes regarded as not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am 

convinced this appraisal is quite wrong.

While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall and one-track 

concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you have merely to read his works on capital 

and general equilibrium (vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow); 

on the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal cost pricing and 

imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms 

generated by uneven exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which impinge 

on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-regular rhythms whose periods 

depend on its internal structure (vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of 

government expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide Lindahl and 

Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between interest rates set by central banks and 

cumulative trends of inflation or deflation.” (p.1688).
