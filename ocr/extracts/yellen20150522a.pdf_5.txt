and Target, have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that 

larger wage gains are on the horizon.  

This improvement in the labor market has brought the economy closer to one of 

the two goals of monetary policy assigned to the Fed by the Congress--maximum 

employment.  Less progress has been made toward the other goal, price stability.  

Consumer price inflation remains below the Fed’s stated objective of 2 percent.  The 

notion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means 

that wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the 

functioning of the economy--for example, by making it more difficult for households and 

firms to pay off their debts.  Overall consumer price inflation has been especially low--

close to zero--over the past year, as the big fall in oil prices since last summer lowered 

prices for gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products.  But inflation excluding food 

and energy, which is often a better indicator of where overall inflation will be in the 

future, has also been low, below the Fed’s 2 percent objective both now and for almost all 

of the economic recovery.  Inflation has been held down by the continued economic 

weakness during the slow recovery and, more recently, by lower prices of imported 

goods as well as the fall in oil prices.  With oil prices no longer declining, and with the 

public’s expectations of future inflation apparently stable, my colleagues on the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I believe that consumer price inflation will move 

up to 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as other temporary factors 

weighing on inflation recede.   

the BLS’s average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls have increased 2-1/4 percent over 
the 12 months through April.
