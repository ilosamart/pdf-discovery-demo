Between the 1930s and mid-1970s, women’s participation in the economy 

continued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase in work among married 

women.  By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were 

participating in the labor force.7  Several factors contributed to this rise.  First, with the 

advent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially.8  At the same 

time, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and 

these jobs were increasingly taken on by women.  Moreover, because these jobs tended to 

be cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished.  And 

while there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these 

formal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.  

Another innovation was the introduction in the late 1940s of part-time schedules, which 

combined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for 

married women to work outside the home.9   

Over the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for 

highly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke 

College, to work in professions.  That said, early in that period, most women still 

expected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners 

whose husbands’ careers came first.  Thus, while it was becoming more common for 

women such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects 

were not the same as those for men.  After earning her Ph.D. at Wisconsin, Betty married 

a fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and

older, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those aged 15 and older.
