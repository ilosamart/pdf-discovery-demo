At root, then, prudential regulation seeks to influence risk-taking in regulated entities.  

But this is difficult to do directly.  Conceptually, “risk” is not reducible to a single metric, such 

as--for example--the density of particulate matter in the emissions of a power plant.  Practically 

speaking, a financial institution more or less continually makes risk decisions, the circumstances 

of which can vary substantially over time, across asset classes, and even contemporaneously in a 

single asset class based on the differing circumstances of borrowers or counterparties.   

Prudential rules can limit or prohibit certain bank activities that are thought to be 

particularly risky.  With respect to activities that are permitted, prudential regulation can 

indirectly influence corporate decisions on risk-taking by requiring minimum amounts of capital 

to be held by the regulated firms.  But, fundamental as they are to contemporary prudential 

regulation, capital requirements--particularly static, backward-looking standards--will 

necessarily be somewhat imprecisely related to the range of actual risk incident to specific assets 

or transactions within the various risk categories established by the capital regime.  In fact, the 

capital regime may itself invite arbitrage, as firms look to maximize risk-taking within regulatory 

risk categories.7   

Thus it is also important for prudential regulation to influence the processes of risk-

taking within regulated financial firms as a complementary tool to capital requirements and other 

substantive measures.  This view is reflected in various banking laws, most notably in the Dodd-

Frank Act requirement that all bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets have a 

risk committee, composed of independent directors and “responsible for the oversight of the 

                                                 
7 Of course, strong capital requirements also build a loss absorption buffer that is useful in dealing with risks gone 
bad ex post, even if they cannot entirely contain those risks ex ante.
