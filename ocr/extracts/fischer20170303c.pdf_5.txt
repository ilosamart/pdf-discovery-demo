So, why policy committees?  What makes them so special?  There are several 

reasons to prefer decisionmaking by committee:  For one thing, each committee member 

brings to the table his or her own perspective or view of the world, as well as valuable 

information that others on the committee haven’t heard.  Moreover, committees are less 

likely to take extreme positions--discussion, deliberation, and voting tends to drive policy 

outcomes toward compromise.  Committees also tend to be less volatile or activist, 

imparting an inertia to policymaking that could be desirable--or perhaps undesirable 

when activism is required.8  Finally, academic studies have shown that a combination of 

forecasts is more accurate, over time, than a single forecast.9  Putting it all together, 

committees are, on average, likely to make better monetary policy decisions than 

individuals--an assertion that has received support from academic experiments in which 

undergraduate students played a part. 

Notwithstanding the shift toward monetary policy committees, each central bank 

and its institutional structure reflects the politics and culture of the country that it serves 

(or “countries” in the case of the European Central Bank).  The Federal Reserve is no 

exception, as Lowenstein’s book demonstrates.  In the years before 1913, the United 

States suffered through a series of financial crises culminating in the Panic of 1907.  That 

panic convinced many important stakeholders--William Jennings Bryan, the leader of the 

Populist movement; Paul Warburg, a prominent financier; Nelson Aldrich, a powerful 

Republican senator; and Carter Glass, the Democratic chair of the House Committee on 

                                                 
8 In an experimental study in which undergraduates played a monetary policy game by themselves and in 
groups of five, Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot (2005) found group decisions to be more inertial than 
individual decisions but closer to that of a policy rule, although Blinder and Morgan (2005) found that 
groups were no different from individuals in terms of policy activism.  A recent study by Ruge-Murcia and 
Riboni (forthcoming) of Bank of Israel policy before and after its change from a single governor to a 
committee found that committee decisions were more inertial than individual ones.
