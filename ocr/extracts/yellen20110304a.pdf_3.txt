In the case of the recent global financial crisis and recession, I would apportion 

responsibility to inadequacies in both the monetary and financial systems.  With respect 

to the international monetary system, the basic story is now quite familiar:  Strong capital 

outflows from countries with chronic current account surpluses--in part reflecting heavily 

managed exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and other shortcomings in the operation 

of the international monetary system--put downward pressure on real interest rates, in 

turn boosting asset prices (particularly for housing) and enhancing the availability of 

credit.  These developments contributed significantly to the buildup of financial 

imbalances, but they were not, on their own, sufficient to have engendered the massive 

financial crisis we experienced. 

Had the additional domestic credit associated with these capital inflows been used 

effectively, the imbalances need not have led to financial ruin.  In the United States and 

other countries with current account deficits, however, borrowing too often supported 

excessive spending on housing and consumption, rather than financing productive 

investment.  Most important, declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending 

oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased use of opaque financial products, 

and more-general inadequacies in risk management by private financial institutions 

helped foster a dangerous and unsustainable credit boom.  With the financial system 

evolving rapidly, supervisors and regulators, both in the United States and in many other 

countries, failed to recognize and address the mounting vulnerabilities.  In short, these 

failures rooted in the financial system interacted with weaknesses in the global monetary 

system to create stresses and instabilities that eventually triggered--and amplified--the 

recent financial crisis and subsequent recession.
