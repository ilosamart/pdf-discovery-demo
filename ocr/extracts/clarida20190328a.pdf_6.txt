Yet, in these episodes, accommodative policy responses in the United States 

helped ward off actual contractions of U.S. activity.  During the 2011-13 euro-zone 

recession, the United States was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the 

wake of the Global Financial Crisis, but the timing of the maturity extension program and 

the third phase of U.S. quantitative easing suggests they were helpful responses to the 

spillovers to the United States from this downturn.11  For the China episode of 2015 and 

’16, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements from the time indicate that 

concerns about foreign developments and their effect on U.S. financial conditions were a 

factor contributing to the delay in previously anticipated policy rate increases, thereby 

supporting the economy.   

The message from these recent episodes is not just about the importance of timely 

policy adjustments by the central bank.  It is also about the importance of the enhanced 

resilience of financial institutions that has been achieved since the Global Financial 

Crisis.  Undoubtedly, this resilience helped prevent adverse financial shocks from 

contributing to a more serious downturn.   

Recent Developments  

 Let me conclude with some remarks on recent developments.  U.S. and other 

financial markets are attuned to a number of prominent downside global risks, which 

include Brexit, a sharp slowdown in global growth prospects, and trade tensions.  

Even though the Fed has been and is committed to a dual mandate to achieve 

maximum employment and  price stability,  in today’s world, U.S. policymakers can 

                                                 
11 The quantitative easing was important, because the United States had already reduced the policy rate to 
zero and--as argued, for example, in Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2009)--the spillover effects of 
adverse foreign demand shocks to the U.S. economy are significantly amplified at the zero lower bound for 
the policy rate in the absence of other expansionary policies.
