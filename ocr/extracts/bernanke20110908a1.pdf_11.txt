international competitiveness that, if anything, has improved in recent years.  Our 

economy retains its traditional advantages of a strong market orientation, a robust 

entrepreneurial culture, and flexible capital and labor markets.  And our country remains 

a technological leader, with many of the world's leading research universities and the 

highest spending on research and development of any nation.  Thus I do not expect the 

long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the financial 

crisis and the recession if--and I stress if--our country takes the necessary steps to secure 

that outcome.  Economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, and every 

household and business must cope with the stresses and uncertainties that our current 

situation presents.  These are not easy tasks.  I have no doubt, however, that those 

challenges can be met, and that the fundamental strengths of our economy will ultimately 

reassert themselves.  The Federal Reserve will certainly do all that it can to help restore 

high rates of growth and employment in a context of price stability.
