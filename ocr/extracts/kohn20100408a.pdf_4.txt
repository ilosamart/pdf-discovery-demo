On the negative side, some sectors of the economy remain quite weak.  Home sales, 

which seemed for a time last year to be starting to slowly recover, have stalled recently, and 

housing starts are only a little above last year’s low.  Moreover, nonresidential building 

continues to contract amid rising vacancy rates, plunging property prices, and strained financing 

conditions.  And, as I’m sure you are only too aware, difficult fiscal conditions have restrained 

spending by state and local governments.  The latest data on employment and construction 

suggest that spending by state and local governments has continued to decline this year. 

Signs of recovery are just beginning to emerge in the labor market.  Private payrolls 

appear to have bottomed out earlier this year and to have posted a noticeable increase in March, 

and the unemployment rate is down a bit from its recent high.  Despite that good news, the labor 

market remains extremely weak.  Businesses, facing considerable uncertainty and under pressure 

from weak sales and tight financial conditions, have been reluctant to hire even though output 

has begun to recover and instead have found ways to boost worker efficiency.  Indeed, output per 

hour in the nonfarm business sector is reported to have risen almost 6 percent during 2009.  But 

such outsized productivity gains are not likely to continue.  If labor productivity growth slows to 

a more normal rate of increase, then further increases in demand and production should lead to 

additional increases in hiring.  However, if economic growth remains moderate, as I anticipate, 

employment gains are likely to lower the unemployment rate only slowly. 

An ongoing concern in this recovery is whether unemployed workers may experience 

unusual difficulties in re-entering the workforce.  The duration of unemployment has been 

exceptionally long in this business cycle, a development that could erode worker skills and 

decrease re-employment probabilities.  In addition, it may take some time for those who are 

unemployed to move or retrain for the new jobs that the recovery will bring.  For these and other
