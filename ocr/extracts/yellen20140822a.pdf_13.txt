Implications of Labor Market Developments for Monetary Policy 

The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor 

market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of 

determining the state of the economy relative to the FOMC’s objective of maximum 

employment.  In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these 

difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of 

monetary policy.   

Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  For much 

of the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and substantial 

degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below-

target inflation.  In such circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is 

unambiguous, in my view. 

However, with the economy getting closer to our objectives, the FOMC’s 

emphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how

     The interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part 

because the strong trends in participation due to demographic factors have implied that it is difficult to 

identify the cyclical component.  For an important example of a study demonstrating, within the core 

macroeconomic framework widely used in research, that movements in participation should be considered 

in models of wage and price determination, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor 

Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper
