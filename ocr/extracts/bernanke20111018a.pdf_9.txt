issued covered bonds between July 2009 and June 2010 to improve liquidity in a key

The ECB has also bought the sovereign bonds of some vulnerable euro-area countries, 

“to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional,”

operations.6 

In most cases, the use of balance sheet policies for macroeconomic stabilization 

purposes has reflected the constraints on more-conventional policies as short-term 

nominal interest rates reach very low levels.  In more normal times, when short-term 

policy rates are not constrained, I expect that balance sheet policies will be rarely used.  

By contrast, forward guidance and other forms of communication about policy can be 

valuable even when the zero lower bound is not relevant, and I expect to see increasing 

use of such tools in the future. 

Financial Stability Policy 

 Even as central banks were innovative in the operation of their monetary policies, 

they were forced to be equally innovative in restoring and maintaining financial stability.  

Serving as a lender of last resort--standing ready in a crisis to lend to solvent but illiquid 

financial institutions that have adequate collateral--is, of course, a traditional function of 

central banks.  Indeed, the need for an institution that could serve this function was a 

primary motivation for the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.  The Federal 

Reserve’s discount window is an example of a facility that operates in normal times to 

provide very short-term liquidity to depository institutions.  Most other central banks
