stance of U.S. monetary policy.12  This conclusion has been reached using both 

econometric models and purely statistical analyses that make no use of economic theory. 

To demonstrate this finding in a simple way, I will use a statistical model 

developed by Federal Reserve Board researchers that summarizes the historical 

relationships among key macroeconomic indicators, house prices, and monetary policy 

(Dokko and others, 2009).  The statistical technique employed in this model, known as 

vector autoregression, is familiar to econometricians who seek to analyze the joint 

evolution of a collection of data series over time.  The model incorporates seven 

variables, including measures of economic growth, inflation, unemployment, residential 

investment, house prices, and the federal funds rate, and it is estimated using data from 

1977 to 2002.13  For our purposes, the value of such a model is that it can be used to 

predict the behavior of any of the variables being studied, assuming that historical 

relationships hold and that the other variables in the system take on their actual historical 

values. 

Slide 6 illustrates the application of this procedure to the federal funds rate and 

housing prices over the period from 2003 to 2008.  In the left panel of the figure, the solid 

line shows the actual history of the federal funds rate.  The shaded area in the figure is 

constructed using the results of the statistical model; it shows the range of possible 

outcomes that would be considered “normal” for the federal funds rate, assuming that the 

other six variables included in the model took their actual values during the years 2003 

through 2008.  Values of the federal funds rate that fall in the shaded area are relatively

question.
