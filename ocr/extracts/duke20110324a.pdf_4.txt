The panel interviews were concluded in early 2010, and Board staff spent most of the rest 

of the year preparing this complex set of data for analysis.  Earlier today, the Federal Reserve 

published a research paper providing an overview of the data, and further results are expected to 

follow.1   

Changes in Household Wealth 

The shocks to household wealth associated with the most recent recession were 

extraordinary by any measure.  According to the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts, 

household net worth peaked in the second quarter of 2007 and then fell approximately 28 percent 

during the next two years (figure 1).   

  The initial shocks to housing and to financial assets wiped out most of the wealth gains 

realized since the aftermath of the tech crash in 2001.  There has been some recovery in wealth 

since the trough, but since early 2010 it has remained fairly flat.   

The personal saving rate, which had been trending downward before the recession, 

jumped during the crisis as spending retreated (figure 2).  Traditional macroeconomic analysis 

would attribute at least some of the increase in the saving rate and corresponding drag in the 

recovery of consumer spending to diminished household wealth.  That direct effect might be 

compounded if the wealth decline also affected consumers’ confidence and expectations, which 

could affect families’ future decisions.  For example, workers on the cusp of retirement might 

need to work longer than they had planned and business owners might be unable or unwilling to 

leverage their personal assets to fund or expand their businesses.  In addition, if attitudes toward
