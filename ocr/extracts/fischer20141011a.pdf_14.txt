Second, the tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has 

advanced far enough, in terms both of reducing the output gap and of moving the 

inflation rate closer to our 2 percent goal.  Thus, tightening should occur only against the 

backdrop of a strengthening U.S. economy and in an environment of improved household 

and business confidence.  The stronger U.S. economy should directly benefit our foreign 

trading partners by raising the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by 

boosting confidence globally.  And if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the 

consequences for the U.S. economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more 

slowly than otherwise.   

Third, the EMEs themselves have generally done a good job of reducing their 

financial and economic vulnerabilities over the past couple of decades, which should 

bolster their resilience should normalization lead to financial market stresses.  Since the 

1990s, many EMEs have made remarkable progress on reducing inflation, improving 

government debt ratios, building foreign reserves, and better regulating and capitalizing 

their banking systems.  In addition, the development of local-currency debt markets has 

made EMEs less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.  To be sure, some EMEs 

continue to face a wide array of structural and policy challenges, including, prominently, 

rapid credit growth.  But it does not seem that the overall risks to global financial stability 

are unusually elevated at this time, and they are very likely substantially less than they 

were going into the financial crisis.   

Nevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those 

that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization 

somewhat bumpier.  This gives all the more reason for the Fed and other major central
