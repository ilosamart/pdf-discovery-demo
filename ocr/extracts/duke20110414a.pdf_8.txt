heightened requirements played a role in their denials.6  Among the small businesses that 

were tracked, 21 percent had chosen not to apply for loans for fear of being denied credit, 

and 5 percent also refrained from seeking external equity financing for fear of being 

denied such financing.  So it seems that perceptions of credit tightness may lead some 

small business owners to decide not even to try to obtain additional funding.  

At this time, however, the net percentage of survey respondents telling the NFIB 

that they expect credit conditions to become tighter over the next three months has come 

down considerably from what small business owners reported during 2009.  This 

decrease suggests that, compared with the previous few years, far fewer small business 

owners are expecting that credit conditions will remain tight. 

Overall, what seems to matter most with regard to funding, from the small 

business owner’s viewpoint, is one’s personal savings or assets, the internally generated 

funds derived from operating the business, expected sales, and the fact that credit 

conditions seem to be less tight, so money is available, if and when it is needed. 

Business Conditions for Small Businesses  

 Currently, expectations about future sales seem to be more important than 

expectations about the availability of credit in driving business spending decisions and 

demand for business loans.  Recently, small business owners appear to have become 

more optimistic about their outlook for sales.  For example, in recent NFIB surveys, the 

net percentage of respondents who expected their sales to increase rose to levels not seen 

since mid-2007 (figure 3).
