Recent Changes in Federal Reserve System Governance 

In recent years, the governance of the Federal Reserve System has continued to 

evolve. The 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

provided that directors representing financial institutions--the class A directors, of which 

there are three on each Reserve Bank board--may not participate in the appointment of 

Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents.  The Federal Reserve Board has long 

had policies preventing Reserve Bank directors from participating in supervisory matters 

or in determining the appointment of any Reserve Bank officer whose primary duties 

involve supervisory matters.  These directors continue to provide highly valuable 

information about developments in their markets, and take part fully in other roles with 

the other six directors. 

Another aspect of governance involves the better representation of women and 

minorities in the Federal Reserve System.  Indeed, while I have focused my remarks on 

the history of geographical diversity in the Federal Reserve System, we also strive to 

have diversity in gender and race both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks.  In recent 

years, the Reserve Banks’ boards of directors have made significant progress along these 

lines.  Women now account for 34 percent of the directors, up from 24 percent five years 

ago.  In addition, minorities now account for 29 percent of directors, up from 19 percent 

five years ago. 

Conclusion 

The long history of political discourse in the United States helps explain the 

Federal Reserve’s unique structure, in which the Board of Governors in Washington and 

the 12 regional Reserve Banks share power over monetary policy (as shown in figure 1).
