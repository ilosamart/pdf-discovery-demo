The red solid line in figure 7 shows the policy prescription using the original 1993 

Taylor rule together with the September SEP dots for the federal funds rate.20  The 

Taylor rule prescription has been derived using the median value for core PCE price 

inflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the 

September 2016 SEP. 

The intercept in this Taylor rule represents the longer-run real interest rate--or r*--

which is set to 2 percent.  If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r* 

implied by the most recent SEP, which is 0.9 percent, we see that the rule prescribes 

much lower settings for policy interest rates than the unadjusted rule (the blue dashed line 

in figure 7).  The lower intercept does not completely close the gap between the Taylor 

rule prescription and the dots.  However, many observers believe that the neutral real 

interest rate is currently well below its longer-run value.  The language that has appeared 

in the Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “the federal funds 

rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the 

longer run” is consistent with this view.21 

We can estimate a short-run, time-varying r* using a standard reduced-form IS 

(investment and saving) equation that relates the unemployment gap to its own lagged 

value and the lagged real interest rate gap.  We use the median of FOMC participants’ 

                                                 
20 The SEP policy projections are for the midpoint of the federal funds rate target range at the end of a 
calendar year.  The Taylor (1993) rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – 2) + 0.5Yt.  In this expression, R 
is the federal funds rate, π is the percent change in the core PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and 
Y is the output gap.  The rule used here is in terms of the unemployment gap instead of the output gap.  The 
output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.0(U* – Ut), where U is the 
unemployment rate and U* is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.
