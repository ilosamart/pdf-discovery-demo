Good morning.  I am sorry that I am not able to be with you today at the FRBNY for this 

important meeting.  I thought that I would begin by discussing the LIBOR related events that 

have brought us here, and then talk about the way forward.

transactions, let me share some data regarding activity in U.S. dollar wholesale funding markets.
