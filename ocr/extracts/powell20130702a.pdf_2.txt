Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today.1  I join others in thanking Mr. 

Stephan for his service, and in welcoming Ms. Stirbock to her new role as Chief 

Representative of the Deutsche Bundesbank in the United States.  I look forward to 

working with both of you, and with your colleagues, in the coming years.  The Federal 

Reserve places great importance on our relations with the Bundesbank.  Few such 

relationships have been as important, over the decades, in promoting financial stability

At the end of 2007, just prior to the onset of the last recession, the United States 

had federal government debt equal to about 36 percent of the size of our annual gross 

domestic product (GDP)--a moderate level.  Since 2007, and largely as a consequence of 

the recession and policy actions to help alleviate its effects, the U.S. federal governmentâ€™s
