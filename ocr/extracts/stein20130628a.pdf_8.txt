clues about the future stance of monetary policy should take care not to over-interpret 

these movements.  We have attempted in recent weeks to provide more clarity about the 

nature of our policy reaction function, but I view the fundamentals of our underlying 

policy stance as broadly unchanged. 

Thank you.  I look forward to your questions .
