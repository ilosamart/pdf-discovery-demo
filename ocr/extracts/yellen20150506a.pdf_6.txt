failure of a systemic institution would inflict on the financial system and the economy.  

Higher capital standards provide large, complex institutions with an incentive to reduce 

their systemic footprint.  We are also employing annual stress tests to gauge large 

institutions’ ability to weather a very severe downturn and distress of counterparties and, 

importantly, continue lending to households and businesses.  Firms that do not meet these 

standards face restrictions on dividends and share buybacks.  As a result of these changes, 

for the largest banks, Tier 1 common equity--the highest-quality form of capital--has 

more than doubled since the financial crisis.   

New liquidity regulations will also improve incentives in the financial system.  

Prior to the crisis, institutions’ incentives to rely on short-term borrowing to fund 

investments in riskier or less liquid instruments were distorted in two important ways.  

First, many investors were willing to accept a very low interest rate on short-term 

liabilities of financial institutions or on securitizations without demanding adequate 

compensation for severe-but-unlikely risks, such as a temporary loss of market liquidity.  

Perhaps these firms expected government support or simply considered illiquidity a very 

remote possibility.  Second, institutions’ attempts to shift their holdings once concerns 

about credit or liquidity risk arose created a fire-sale dynamic that amplified declines in 

market values, causing unanticipated spillovers onto other institutions and across 

markets.10   

Recently implemented regulations aim to strengthen liquidity.  For example, a 

new liquidity coverage ratio requires internationally active banking organizations to hold 

10 The notion that securities issued by financial institutions may provide liquidity services in a manner that 
potentially contributes to fragility because such securities do not have the safety and liquidity of publicly 
issued securities is examined in, for example, Gorton, Lewellen, and Metrick (2012); Stein (2012); and 
Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).
