have few or no trading assets of any sort, so proprietary trading is obviously not a concern there 

either.  While the regulatory agencies have tried to tailor the rules so as to avoid burdening these 

banks, even the process of figuring out that the rules do not constrain them is a compliance cost 

that should be eliminated.  One approach would be to exempt all banks with less than $10 billion 

in assets and other banks that report less than some nominal amount of trading assets.  

Capital Regulation 

Let me now turn to capital.  The history of financial regulation over the last several 

decades is in many respects defined by an increasing emphasis on capital requirements and, 

specifically, higher minimum ratios based on a more rigorous definition of what constitutes loss-

absorbing capital.  This tendency can be explained by the fact that capital is a particularly supple 

prudential tool.  As activity and affiliation restrictions on banks have been loosened, and as the 

integration of traditional lending with capital markets has created new financial products at a 

rapid pace, capital requirements can provide a buffer against losses from any activities.   

 No single measure of capital is sufficient to ensure an adequate buffer however.  Simple 

leverage ratios are a good check on banks becoming too debt dependent, but they encourage 

more risk-taking, insofar as they impose the same capital charge for every asset, no matter how 

risky.  Standardized risk-based capital ratios implement the intuitively appealing notion that a 

bank’s capital should depend on the riskiness of its assets.  But the grouping of individual loans 

and securities into necessarily broad categories of risk weights (e.g., residential mortgages) can 

be arbitraged.  And a firm holding lots of assets that look very low-risk in normal times can be 

vulnerable if its total leverage is high during stress periods.  Models-based capital requirements 

can better distinguish among risks to some degree, and they can be made more forward-looking 

than static leverage or risk-based ratios.  But, to the extent that banks’ internal models are used, it
