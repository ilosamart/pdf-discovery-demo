I would like to thank the staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 

inviting me to attend this awards ceremony.1   As many of you may already know, the 

Leading the Way campaign is a joint effort between the Federal Reserve Bank and the P-

TECH2 schools of the Greater Rochester area.  It is wonderful to be part of an event that 

celebrates collaboration between educational institutions, local government, the Federal 

Reserve, and employers as they work together to provide appropriate training for young 

workers to fill local jobs needs.  Collaboration creates a more vibrant workforce that is 

connected to actual jobs. 

Today’s Job Market 

I have just come from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  

The FOMC is one of the main policymaking committees of the Federal Reserve System.  

Our main job on the FOMC is to set interest rates to achieve the maximum level of 

employment in the country and sustain inflation at a moderate level.   

The nation’s unemployment rate is currently around 4.1 percent, which is a 

relatively low level by historical standards.  What that means for the young people 

participating in this program is that this is a great time to find a job.  Moreover, not only 

is the national unemployment rate low, so are unemployment rates for young people and 

members of ethnic and racial groups that have traditionally faced greater challenges in 

the labor market.  As many of you know, during the deep recession of 2008 and 2009, 

many Americans were so discouraged by poor job prospects that they stopped even 

looking for work.  That meant that too many Americans were sitting on the sidelines.  In
