consumer loans, not shown) account for $322 billion, or 70 percent of the loan losses projected under the more adverse scenario.3 [Footnote 3.Some of these losses have already 
been taken, however, in the form of discounts on impaired loans acquired during mergers. These discounts reduce future estimated credit losses on residential mortgage and 
consumer loans by approximately $57 billion, which was incorporated when calculating the additional capital for the SCAP buffer. End footnote 3.] Estimated loss rates on 
commercial real estate loans, especially those related to land development, also are elevated in the more adverse scenario, reflecting realized and projected substantial declines 
in real estate values. For commercial and industrial loans, estimated loss rates are within the range of those experienced in business downturns in past recent recessions.

historical standards. The two-year cumulative loss rate on total loans equals 9.1 percent in the more
