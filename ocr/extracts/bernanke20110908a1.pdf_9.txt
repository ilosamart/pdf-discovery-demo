have either leveled off or have come down from their highs.  Meanwhile, the step-up in 

automobile production should reduce pressure on car prices.  Importantly, we see little 

indication that the higher rate of inflation experienced so far this year has become 

ingrained in the economy.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable 

according to the indicators we monitor, such as the measure of householdsâ€™ longer-term 

expectations from the Thompson Reuters/University of Michigan survey, the 10-year 

inflation projections of professional forecasters, and the five-year-forward measure of 

inflation compensation derived from yields of inflation-protected Treasury securities.  In 

addition to the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, the substantial amount of 

resource slack that exists in U.S. labor and product markets should continue to have a 

moderating influence on inflationary pressures.  Notably, because of ongoing weakness 

in labor demand over the course of the recovery, nominal wage increases have been 

roughly offset by productivity gains, leaving the level of unit labor costs close to where it 

had stood at the onset of the recession.  Given the large share of labor costs in the 

production costs of most firms, subdued unit labor costs should be an important 

restraining influence on inflation.

strengthen over time, the Committee has responded to recent developments--as I have 

already noted--by marking down its outlook for economic growth over coming quarters.  

The Committee also continues to anticipate that inflation will moderate over time, to a 

rate at or below the 2 percent or a bit less that most FOMC participants consider to be
