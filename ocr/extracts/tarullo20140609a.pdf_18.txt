 As I noted at the outset, there is a long history of actual or considered measures to alter 

the duties or liabilities of those with decisionmaking authority in the corporate governance of 

banks.  A more contemporary variant on these ideas was offered a little over a decade ago by Jon 

Macey and Maureen O’Hara, who proposed expanded fiduciary duties for directors of insured 

banks, including giving bank creditors the right to sue for violations of these duties.17  In a 

provocative recent paper, John Armour and Jeff Gordon suggest that the duties of directors of 

systemically important financial institutions should be modified precisely because diversified 

shareholders have a strong interest in avoiding risk decisions by these institutions that increase 

systemic risk.18  Their analysis implies that the customary tension between regulatory and 

diversified shareholders’ interests may be considerably mitigated in the case of systemically 

important firms whose failure could result in financial turbulence and consequent economic loss 

for the entire economy. 

 A consideration of the merits of these or other such proposals is beyond the scope of my 

remarks today.  Obviously, any such changes in corporate law are beyond the authority of the 

Federal Reserve.  I mention them in the hope and anticipation that corporate law scholars will 

continue to evaluate such ideas, since whatever one’s eventual conclusions on their desirability, 

the analytic process is sure to yield further insights into the key question of how best to respond 

to the points of divergence between shareholder and regulatory interests in risk-taking by large 

financial firms.
