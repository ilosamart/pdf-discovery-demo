regulatory policy, which represents a more tailored response than the flattening out of 

aggregate demand that would likely result from contractionary monetary policy. 


Regulatory Tools 

Some of the significant regulatory tools for addressing asset bubbles--both those in 

widespread use and those on the frontier of regulatory thought--are capital regulation, 

liquidity regulation, regulation of margins and haircuts in securities funding transactions, 

and restrictions on credit underwriting. Without plumbing the depths of each type of tool, 

I’ll say a few words about each as it relates to the curbing of excess credit growth that 

fuels asset bubbles and to mitigating the effects of a bubble’s collapse.  


Capital Regulation  

Capital regulation--in particular, the imposition of minimum capital requirements-- 

increases capital and thereby improves the ability of regulated financial institutions to 

absorb losses and maintain lending after a bubble has burst. More capital reduces the 

probability of institutions’ failure, with the added benefit of reducing the chance of 

funding runs due to loss of confidence.  

But because higher required capital also generally increases the cost of funding 

assets--by increasing the role of capital in the funding mix--it also raises the possibility of 

reducing the supply of credit from regulated institutions, making credit more expensive. 

Thus, higher capital requirements, to some degree, also lean against excessive credit 

growth that can fuel asset bubbles.
