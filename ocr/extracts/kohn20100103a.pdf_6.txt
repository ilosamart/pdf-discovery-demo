implemented in early 2009 with the support of the Treasury Department.  As we affirmed 

at the December FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve is in the process of winding down 

and closing most of our extraordinary liquidity windows.   

 Our announcements of purchases of agency MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities helped to lower long-term interest rates and increase the availability of 

mortgages to households and bond financing to businesses.  In addition, our near-zero 

policy rate and the improving economic outlook have induced shifts by private investors 

into longer-term and riskier assets, helping to reverse a portion of the previous spike in 

spreads that occurred as the economy and financial markets deteriorated.  With markets 

improving and the economy expanding, the FOMC has also indicated that it is tapering 

down its purchases of Treasury, MBS, and agency securities.   

 But the cost of credit remains relatively high and its availability relatively limited 

for many borrowers.  Although many long-term interest rates are fairly low, spreads in 

bond markets are somewhat elevated--not surprising, perhaps, as many borrowers are still 

under stress with the unemployment rate quite high and utilization of the capital stock 

still very low.  Some securitization markets continue to be effectively closed or severely 

impaired, including those for larger home mortgages and commercial real estate loans.

businesses have cut back on inventories and households have been rebuilding their 

balance sheets by increasing saving.  But the weakness in bank lending also results from 

cutbacks in supply.  Our surveys show that through late 2009, banks continued to tighten
