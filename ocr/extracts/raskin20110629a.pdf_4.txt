Unfortunately, the headline unemployment numbers don’t fully capture the true 

scope of the unemployment problem. There are an additional 8.5 million workers who are 

“part-time-of-necessity” or “underemployed” because their hours have been cut back or 

they are unable to find a full-time job; there are also 1.4 million workers who are 

“marginally attached” to the labor force because, while wanting a job, they have not 

searched for one in the past four weeks; and there are 822,000 “discouraged” workers 

who have given up searching for employment because they do not believe any jobs are 

available for them.2  

So it is not just those who are currently collecting unemployment insurance 

payments who are excluded.  The underemployed, the marginally attached, and the 

discouraged, all of whom are primarily concerned about the security of their jobs, wage 

growth, housing, and the rising cost of living, are also suffering from exclusion from the 

economy of work. 

But most of these people searching for a way back into the employed economy 

are doubly challenged by their ability to access reasonably priced financial products with 

safe features that encourage savings.  Americans have several core financial needs.  They 

need a safe, accessible, and affordable method to deposit or cash checks, receive deposits, 

pay bills, and accrue savings.  They also need access to credit to tide them over before 

their next cash infusion arrives.  They may be coming up short paying their rent, their 

mortgage payment, an emergency medical expense, or an unexpected car repair.  They 

may want access to a savings vehicle that, down the road, will help them pay for these 

items and for education or further training, or to start a business.  And many want some
