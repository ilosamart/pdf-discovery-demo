causes a large price decline, it is that when hedge fund A makes its initial leverage 

choice, it does not take into account the potential harm—in the form of tightened 

financing constraints—that this may cause to hedge funds B and C.6 

 Another key point is that the fire-sales problem is not necessarily caused by a lack 

of appropriate conservatism on the part of whoever lends to hedge fund A in this 

example—let’s call it dealer firm D.  By lending on an overnight basis to A, and with an 

appropriate haircut, D can virtually assure itself of being able to terminate its loan and get 

out whole by forcing a sale of the underlying collateral.  So D’s interests may be very 

well-protected here.  But precisely in the pursuit of this protection, A and D have set up a 

financing arrangement that serves them well, but that creates a negative spillover onto 

other market participants, like B and C.  It follows that even if policies aimed at curbing 

too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problems are entirely successful in aligning D’s interests with 

those of taxpayers, this is not sufficient to deal with fire-sales externalities.  They are a 

fundamentally different problem, and one that arises even absent any individually 

systemic institutions or any TBTF issues.    

Fire-Sale Externalities in Securities Financing Transactions 

The preceding discussion makes clear why SFTs, such as those done via 

repurchase (repo) agreements, are a natural object of concern for policymakers.  This 

market is one where a large number of borrowers finance the same securities on a short-

6 This is the first-round externality.  Adverse spillovers from a fire sale of this sort may also take the form 
of a credit crunch that affects borrowers more generally. Such a credit crunch may arise as other financial 
intermediaries (e.g., banks) withdraw capital from lending, so as to exploit the now-more-attractive returns 
to buying up fire-sold assets. Ultimately, it is the risk of this credit contraction, and its implications for 
economic activity more broadly, that may be the most compelling basis for regulatory intervention.
