institutions.  Reform should not leave us with any institutions that are so important as to be 

candidates for too-big-to-fail.   

Third, we should promote greater competition in this market.  The economics of 

securitization do not require a duopoly.  Yet there is no way for private firms to acquire a GSE 

charter and enter the industry.  This is akin to having only two banks with federal deposit 

insurance, which would make competition by other banks very difficult.  Greater competition 

would help to reduce the systemic importance of the GSEs, and spur more innovation.  Greater 

competition also requires a level playing field, allowing secondary market access to a wide-range 

of lenders and thereby giving homebuyers a choice among many potential mortgage lenders and 

products. 

Fourth, it is worth considering simple approaches that restructure and repurpose parts of 

the existing architecture of our housing finance system.  We know that housing reform is 

difficult; completely redrawing the system may not be necessary and could complicate the search 

for a solution.  Using the existing architecture would allow for a continued smooth, gradual 

transition.   

Fifth and last, we need to identify and build upon areas of bipartisan agreement.  In my 

view, at this late stage we should not be holding out for the perfect answer.  We should be 

looking for the best feasible plan to escape the unacceptable status quo.   

Conclusion 

I see two reasons why this is a good time to address the housing finance systemâ€™s 

shortcomings.  First, the economy and the housing sector are healthy.  It would be far more 

disruptive to implement fundamental structural changes during difficult economic times.
