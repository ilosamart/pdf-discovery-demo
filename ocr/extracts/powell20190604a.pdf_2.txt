Good morning.  I am very pleased to welcome you here today.  This conference is 

part of a first-ever public review by the Federal Open Market Committee of our monetary 

policy strategy, tools, and communications.  We have a distinguished group of experts 

from academics and other walks of life here to share perspectives on how monetary 

policy can best serve the public.  

I’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations 

and other matters.  We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved.  We are 

closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook 

and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 

market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  My comments today, like 

this conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will remain even as the issues of the 

moment evolve.  

While central banks face a challenging environment today, those challenges are 

not entirely new.  In fact, in 1999 the Federal Reserve System hosted a conference titled 

“Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment.”  Conference participants discussed 

new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the Great Inflation.1  

They focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what 

unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell 

to what we now call the effective lower bound (ELB).  Even though the Bank of Japan 

was grappling with the ELB as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the 

United States.  The conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a
