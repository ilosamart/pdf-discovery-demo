Thank you for inviting me here and for offering me what I consider a perfect 

opportunity to speak on a topic at the heart of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote a 

stronger economy--the vital role and growing use of communication in monetary policy.1  

Some of you cover the Federal Reserve and are familiar with how it sets monetary 

policy through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  You know that the FOMC 

pays very close attention to what it says in the statements it issues after each meeting.  

This communication is supplemented by Chairman Bernanke’s postmeeting press 

conferences and by providing detailed minutes of the Committee’s meetings.  Getting this 

message out to the public depends a good deal on the work you do in reporting on the 

FOMC, analyzing its statements and actions, and explaining its role and objectives.  So 

let me begin by thanking you for those contributions.  

But let me also say why I am particularly pleased to speak to you today.  As 

writers and editors, all of you are prodigious consumers and producers of communication.  

At first glance, the FOMC’s communication may not seem so different from what you’ve 

heard other government agencies say about their policies or businesses say about their 

products.  I hope to show how communication plays a distinct and special role in 

monetary policymaking.   

Let me offer a comparison that may highlight that difference.  Suppose, instead of 

monetary policy, we were talking about an example of transportation policy--widening a 

road to ease traffic congestion.  Whether this road project is announced at a televised 

press conference or in a low-key press release--or even if there is no announcement--the 

project is more or less the same.  The benefit to drivers will come after the road is 

                                                 
1 I am indebted to members of the Board staff--Jon Faust, Thomas Laubach, and John Maggs--who 
contributed to the preparation of these remarks.
