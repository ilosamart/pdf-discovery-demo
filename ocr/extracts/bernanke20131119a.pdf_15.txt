sequencing choice, again, was the greater uncertainty about the costs and efficacy of 

LSAPs, relative to the more familiar tool of managing the current short-term interest rate 

and, through forward guidance, expectations of future short-term interest rates.  

Moreover, to the extent that the use of LSAPs engenders additional costs and risks, one 

might expect the tradeoff between the efficacy and costs of this tool to become less 

favorable as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands. 

Having seen progress in the labor market since the beginning of the latest asset 

purchase program in September 2012, the Committee agreed in June of this year to 

provide more-comprehensive guidance about the criteria that would inform future 

decisions about the program.  Consequently, in my press conference following the June 

FOMC meeting, I presented a framework linking the program more explicitly to the 

evolution of the FOMC’s economic outlook.  In particular, I noted the Committee’s 

expectation at the time that improvements in the job market would continue, supported by 

a moderate pickup in growth that would support those gains.  The Committee additionally 

expected that inflation would be moving back toward its 2 percent objective over time.  If 

the incoming data were broadly consistent with that outlook, the Committee would likely 

begin measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases later in 2013.  If the economy 

evolved as anticipated, the end of purchases would occur around midyear 2014.  I also 

emphasized that the path of purchases would depend on incoming data and could be 

slower or faster than envisioned in the modal scenario--indeed, I noted that the pace of 

purchases could be increased for a time, if warranted. 

The framework I discussed in June implied that substantial additional asset 

purchases over the subsequent quarters were likely, with even more purchases possible if
