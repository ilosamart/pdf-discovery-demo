revised substantially in hindsight.  To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the 

unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19  We also need to pick 

values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his 

seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 

There are still other choices to make.  Traditional policy rules are backward 

looking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output.  But monetary 

policy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on 

forecasts of inflation and output.  Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times 

are particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming 

information.21  That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down 

the movement of rates over time.  Each of these insights has some validity, and each has 

important implications for the prescriptions of a policy rule. 

                                                 
19 In general, the unemployment rate is more informative of the state of the business cycle than GDP 
because of the difficulties in estimating potential output.  See Charles A. Fleischman and John M. Roberts

Unobserved Components Model,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011-46 (Washington:  Board

Review, vol. 57 (May), pp. 411-25.  In discussing the effects of uncertainty on monetary policy, Blinder 
(1998, p. 11) notes that policymakers “should compute the direction and magnitude of their optimal policy 
move . . . and then do less.”  See Alan S. Blinder (1998), Central Banking in Theory and Practice 
(Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press).  Others have suggested that inertia may be a feature of making decisions 
by committee; see Clare Lombardelli, James Proudman, and James Talbot (2005), “Committees versus 
Individuals:  An Experimental Analysis of Monetary Policy Decision Making,” International Journal of 
Central Banking, vol. 1 (June), pp. 181-205; and Francisco Ruge-Murcia and Alessandro Riboni
