reducing costs during the recession, nonfinancial corporations have built substantial 

internal funds, and firms with access to capital markets have been finding them generally 

receptive.  Corporate bond issuance for both investment-grade and high-yield issues 

remained quite solid through November.  My expectation is that the interaction of an 

ongoing recovery in economic activity and improved credit conditions will over time 

produce a moderate acceleration in equipment and software investment. 

Unfortunately, the outlook for commercial real estate is much less favorable.  Hit 

hard by the loss of businesses and employment, a good deal of retail, office, and 

industrial space is standing vacant.  In addition, many businesses have cut expenses by 

renegotiating existing leases.  The combination of reduced cash flows and higher rates of 

return required by investors leads to lower valuations, and many existing buildings are 

selling at a loss.  As a result, credit conditions in this market are particularly strained.  

Commercial mortgage delinquency rates have soared.  According to our October survey 

of senior loan officers, banks continued to tighten standards on CRE loans and, 

presumably in light of the poor economic outlook for the sector, appear to have been 

reluctant to refinance maturing construction and land development loans.  In addition, the 

CMBS market has only just recently seen its first activity in a year and a half. 

In this environment, a turnaround in CRE is likely to lag the improvement in 

overall economic activity.  However, compared with the situation in the early 1990s, the 

problems in this sector now appear to be due largely to poor business fundamentals rather 

than widespread overbuilding, suggesting that the performance of the CRE sector will 

gradually begin to improve as the economy continues to strengthen.
