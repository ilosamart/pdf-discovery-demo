  U.S. law also allows well-managed and well-capitalized 

foreign banks to conduct a wide range of bank and nonbank activities in the United States under 

conditions comparable to those applied to U.S. banking organizations.   

Still, it is worth noting that even as there has been continuity in this basic policy, U.S. 

regulation of foreign banks has evolved over the years in response to changes in the extent and 

nature of foreign bank activities.  Let me mention two examples. 

Before 1978, foreign bank branches in the United States were licensed and regulated by 

individual states, with little in the way of federal regulation or restrictions.  They were not 

subject to the full panoply of limitations on interstate banking, equity investments, or affiliations 

with securities firms that were applicable to domestic banks.  The rapid growth of foreign 

banking in the 1970s, particularly branching, prompted an end to this lighter regulatory regime.

The International Banking Act of 1978 gave the Federal Reserve Board regulatory authority over 

the domestic operations of foreign banks and significantly equalized regulatory treatment of 

foreign and domestic firms.

  Congress maintained this approach of basic competitive equality in 

the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

  That law substantially removed restrictions on affiliations 

between commercial banks and other kinds of financial firms for both domestic and foreign

 Cross-border branches of foreign banks operate in the United States as a direct branch of the foreign parent and are 

not separately capitalized entities.  Federal foreign branches and agencies are authorized by 12 U.S.C. §3102, which 

recognizes that states may also authorize branches of foreign banks to operate within their territory.  The Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System must approve all foreign branches and agencies, whether state or federal 

(see 12 U.S.C.§3105(d)).  A good survey of the considerations for both firms and policymakers in the choice 

between subsidiaries and branches for foreign banks is provided in Jonathan Fiechter, Inci Otker-Robe, Anna Ilyina, 

Michael Hsu, Andre Santos, and Jay Surti (2011), “Subsidiaries or Branches: Does One Size Fit All?” Staff

 Between 1972 and 1977, the number of foreign banking institutions in the United States roughly doubled, while 

the total assets of those institutions roughly tripled in absolute terms and doubled as a proportion of all banking 

assets in the United States, reaching nearly 13 percent.  Henry Terrell and Sydney Key (1977), “The Growth of 

Foreign Banking in the United States: An Analytical Survey,” in Key Issues in International Banking, Conference
