enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our supervision of the 

largest, most-complex financial firms.  An important milestone in this regard was the 

Federal Reserveâ€™s leadership in the spring of 2009 of the Supervisory Capital Assessment 

Program, popularly known as the bank stress test, which comprehensively evaluated the 

health of the largest banking organizations in the country.  We learned valuable lessons 

from that exercise, including an appreciation of the additional insights that can be gained 

by examining a number of major institutions simultaneously, with a focus on comparative 

performance.  Another lesson of the stress test was the value of a multidisciplinary 

approach to supervision, one that combines the skills of economists, financial experts, 

payments systems analysts, and other specialists with those of supervisors and examiners.   

Drawing on this experience, we created a high-level, multidisciplinary working 

group within the Federal Reserve to oversee the supervision of large financial 

institutions.  Under the auspices of this committee--called the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee, or LISCC--Federal Reserve supervisors, supported 

by economists and other experts, now routinely use horizontal, or cross-firm, reviews to 

monitor industry practices, common investment or funding strategies, changes in the 

degree or form of financial interconnectedness, or other developments with implications 

for systemic risk.  Supplementing its individual and horizontal reviews, the LISCC has 

also made increasing use of improved quantitative methods for evaluating the health and 

performance of supervised firms as well as the risks they may pose to the broader 

financial system.  A similar committee structure within the Federal Reserve is being 

developed to help us meet our obligations to supervise systemically important financial 

market utilities.
