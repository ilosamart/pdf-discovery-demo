$1.2 trillion flowed out of prime money funds--the more fragile funds that also provide 

direct funding to large banking institutions--toward government money funds, which are 

constrained to hold government-guaranteed assets.  Those assets include repurchase 

agreements (or repos) with private banks backed by Treasury securities and the liabilities 

of government-sponsored enterprises, such as, notably, the Federal Home Loan Banks 

(FHLBs).  While the current configuration of money markets reveals a reduced financial 

stability risk compared with the situation prior to the recent reforms, this configuration 

may not yet represent the final equilibrium.  It will be important to keep an eye on the 

growth of alternative investment vehicles that perform liquidity transformation in money 

markets.  

Of note, in part supported by increased demand from government-only money 

funds, the FHLB system has increased its issuance of shorter-maturity liabilities, which 

are more attractive to money funds.  In turn, this development has led to an increase in 

the FHLB system’s maturity transformation because its assets--loans to banks and 

insurance companies--have remained relatively long maturity.  As a result, the FHLBs 

face an increased need to roll over maturing liabilities and thus greater vulnerability 

should they encounter liquidity pressures.  I should note that the FHLBs’ regulator, the 

Federal Housing Finance Agency (also known as the FA-FA) flagged this issue more 

than a year ago and is working with the FHLBs (the FLUBS) to address it.   

Asset valuations 

Let me conclude my assessment of current financial stability conditions with a 

discussion of asset valuation pressures.  Prices of risky assets have increased in most 

major asset markets in recent months even as risk-free rates also rose.  In equity markets,
