Interest rate futures and interest rate swaps markets provide one source of high-

frequency information about the path and destination for the federal funds rate expected 

by market participants (figure 3).  Interest rate option markets, under certain assumptions, 

can offer insights about the entire ex ante probability distribution of policy rate outcomes 

for calendar dates near or far into the future (figure 4).  And, indeed, when one reads that 

a future policy decision by the Fed or any central bank is “fully priced in,” this is usually 

based on a “straight read” of futures and options prices.  But these signals from interest 

rate derivatives markets are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under 

the assumption of a zero risk premium.  For this reason, it is useful to compare policy rate 

paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market 

participants, which, while subject to measurement error, should not be contaminated with 

a term premium.  Market- and survey-based estimates of the policy rate path are often 

highly correlated.  But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the 

policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I 

place at least as much weight on the survey evidence (for example, derived from the 

surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of New York) as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices (figure 3). 

The Treasury yield curve can provide another source of information about the 

expected path and ultimate longer-run destination of the policy rate.  But, again, the yield 

curve, like the interest rate futures strip, reflects not only expectations of the path of 

short-term interest rates, but also liquidity and term premium factors   Thus, to extract 

signal about policy from noise in the yield curve, a term structure model is required.  But 

different term structure models can and do produce different estimates of the expected
