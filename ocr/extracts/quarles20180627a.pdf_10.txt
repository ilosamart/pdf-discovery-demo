If the FSB had been in place before the crisis and working on identifying and 

assessing vulnerabilities to financial stability, that may have allowed us to take action at 

an earlier stage, frame our response with more information, and possibly mitigate some 

of the devastating consequences.  I can attest to the FSB’s improvement over the pre-

crisis discussions that took place internationally because during the first Bush 

Administration I was a delegate to the informal and more limited group that preceded the 

FSB.   

An important part of the FSB’s work is to endorse minimum standards in different 

areas; for example, identifying the key attributes of effective resolution planning for 

systemically important firms.  In addition, the FSB is in the early stages of some critical 

work that examines the effects that reforms and standards are having.  Are they doing 

what we intended them to do?  Have there been unintended consequences?  Can we make 

the reforms more efficient; that is can we achieve the same effects while lowering the 

burden on institutions and supervisors? 

Once again, you might be wondering why something like resolution regime-

planning should matter to community bankers.  You might be hoping that I get back to 

the good news I delivered earlier, about steps being taken in Washington to tailor 

regulation and reduce the regulatory burden on community banks.  But, of course, these 

are two sides of the same coin.  Appropriately reducing the regulatory burden for 

community banks is possible when we can get an accurate picture of the risks and 

vulnerabilities in the broader financial system, which Utah’s banks are part of and depend

system, but embracing it, assisted by FSB efforts to ensure that reforms are having the
