Introduction:  Econometric Models and a Eureka Moment. 

Eureka moments are rare in all fields, not least in economics.1  One such moment 

came to me when I was an undergraduate at the London School of Economics in the 

1960s.  I was talking to a friend who was telling me about econometric models.  He 

explained that it would soon be possible to build a mathematical model that would 

accurately predict the future course of the economy.  It was but a step from there to 

realize that the problems of policymaking would soon be over.  All it would take was a 

bit of algebra to solve for the policies that would produce the desired values of the target 

variables. 

It was a wonderful prospect, and it remains a wonderful idea.  But it has not yet 

happened.  I want to talk about why not and about some of the consequences for 

policymaking. 

How the Fed Makes Monetary Policy 

Let me begin with how we make monetary policy at the Fed.  The Federal 

Reserve System has both centralized and regional characteristics.  The System comprises 

the Board of Governors, located in Washington, D.C., and 12 regional Reserve Banks in 

cities across the United States (figure 1).  The members of the Board of Governors are 

appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  In contrast, the 

president of each Reserve Bank is selected by that Reserve Bankâ€™s board of directors, 

subject to the approval of the Board of Governors.  This scheme was designed both to
