policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy.  One general finding is 

that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a 

broad range of plausible scenarios.19   More concretely, simulations like these inform our 

risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse 

outcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.   

Finally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights.  

This literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well-known Brainard 

principle, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your 

actions, you should move conservatively.20  In other words, when unsure of the potency 

of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose.  As Brainard made clear, this is not a 

universal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which 

doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much.  The first case is when 

attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended 

period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21  In such situations, the famous 

words “We will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “We will take 

cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.”  The second case is when inflation 

expectations threaten to become unanchored.  If expectations were to begin to drift, the 

reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22  I am 

confident that the FOMC would resolutely “do whatever it takes” should inflation 

expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten.  In addition, a 

                                                 
19 The paper illustrates that some standard intuitions do not hold up in all circumstances.  When following a 

standard Taylor rule and facing a very flat Phillips curve, for example, it is not always good advice to lower 

the weight on the gap between unemployment and u* and to raise the weight on inflation in making policy.
