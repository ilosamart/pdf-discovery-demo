price-to-earnings ratios now stand in the top quintiles of their historical distributions,

historical distributions, and, relative to some non-price-based measures of uncertainty, 

the implied volatility index VIX is particularly subdued.  So far, the evidently high risk 

appetite has not lead to increased leverage across the financial system, but close 

monitoring is warranted.  

Conclusion

and more liquid banking system, less run-prone money markets, and more robust 

resolution mechanisms for large financial institutions.  However, it would be foolish to 

think we have eliminated all risks.  For example, we still have limited insight into parts of
