aimed at ensuring that surpluses in one host jurisdiction generally are not relied upon to meet 

deficits in another host jurisdiction, given the confusion and vulnerabilities such reliance can 

cause in an actual stress.  Specifically, a firm should be able to measure the stand-alone liquidity 

position of each material entity and ensure that liquidity is readily available either at the parent or 

at that entity to meet any deficits.5  As with capital, firms are expected to have a balance of 

prepositioned and centrally managed liquidity--specifically, by balancing the certainty associated 

with holding liquidity directly at material entities against the flexibility provided by holding 

high-quality liquid assets at the parent available to meet unanticipated outflows at material 

entities.  

As a host regulator, our approach to local capital and liquidity regulations of foreign 

banks with large U.S. operations is motivated by the lessons of the recent financial crisis, where 

many foreign banks operating in the United States suffered severe stress and survived only with 

extraordinary support from the United States and their home country governments.  In addition 

to increasing the resiliency of the U.S. operations of foreign banks, our approach also reflects 

both resolution and competitive equity considerations.   

From a resolution perspective, our rules seek to ensure that there are sufficient resources 

in the United States today to ensure that we, as a host regulator, are well positioned to cooperate 

with a home country authority in the event a firm experiences material stress or failure.  Our 

rules also ensure that we do not have a strong incentive to limit flows or seek additional 

resources in the moment of crisis, which could be highly destabilizing in a stress event.
