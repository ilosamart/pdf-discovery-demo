Of course, heavy capital inflows and their volatility pose challenges to emerging 

market policymakers, whatever their source.  Policymakers do have some tools to address 

these concerns.  In recent years, emerging market nations have implemented 

macroprudential measures aimed at strengthening their financial systems and reducing 

overheating in specific sectors, such as property markets.  Policymakers have also 

experimented with various forms of capital controls.  Such controls raise concerns about 

effectiveness, cost of implementation, and possible microeconomic distortions.  

Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has suggested that, in carefully 

circumscribed circumstances, capital controls may be a useful tool.10 

In sum, the advanced industrial economies are currently pursuing appropriately 

expansionary policies to help support recovery and price stability in their own countries.  

As the modern literature on the Great Depression demonstrates, these policies confer net 

benefits on the world economy as a whole and should not be confused with zero- or 

negative-sum policies of trade diversion.  In fact, the simultaneous use by several 

countries of accommodative policy can be mutually reinforcing to the benefit of all.  

Let me end these remarks as I began, by paying tribute to Mervyn King.  He has 

been a leader in the central banking community during an extraordinarily difficult period.  

I wish him the very best in the next stage of his career. 

                                                 
10 Importantly, such circumstances exclude the use of capital controls to avoid other necessary 
macroeconomic policy adjustments, such as greater exchange rate flexibility.  See, for example, 
International Monetary Fund (2012), “The Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows: An 
Institutional View,” (Washington:  International Monetary Fund).
