I appreciate the opportunity to speak at the Salzburg Global Seminar.  Today I will 

discuss our current regulatory regime, and areas where we may be able to make adjustments.  As 

always, the views I express here are my own.1 

We need a resilient, well-capitalized, well-regulated financial system that is strong 

enough to withstand even severe shocks and support economic growth by lending through the 

economic cycle.  The Federal Reserve has approached the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory 

reforms with that outcome in mind.   

There is little doubt that the U.S. financial system is stronger today than it was a decade 

ago.  Loss-absorbing capacity among banks is substantially higher as a result of both regulatory 

requirements and stress testing exercises.  The banking industry, and the largest banking firms in 

particular, face far less liquidity risk than before the crisis.  And progress in resolution planning 

by the largest firms has reduced the threat that their failure would pose.  These efforts have made 

U.S. banking firms both more robust and more resolvable.   

Evidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting 

damage to the economy’s productive capacity and growth potential.  Post-crisis reforms to 

financial sector regulation and supervision have been designed to significantly reduce the 

likelihood and severity of future financial crises.  We have sought to accomplish this goal in 

significant part by reducing both the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the 

consequences of such a failure were it to occur.   

As I mentioned, we have substantially increased the capital, liquidity, and other 

prudential requirements for large banking firms.  These measures are not free.  Higher capital 

requirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs will be passed along to bank 

                                                            
1 These remarks are substantially similar to the testimony delivered at the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, 
& Urban Affairs hearing titled “Fostering Economic Growth: Regulator Perspective” on June 22, 2017.
