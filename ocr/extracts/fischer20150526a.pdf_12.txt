understand and better guard against the financial disruptions that were the genesis of the 

Great Recession.  These efforts have spawned many speeches, including some of my 

own, which testify to our efforts.19  In these speeches, we often emphasize that, given the 

integration of global capital markets, what happens in one market affects others.  Thus, 

our efforts to stabilize the U.S. financial system also have positive spillovers abroad.   

These financial stability responsibilities do not stop at our borders, given the size 

and openness of our capital markets and the unique position of the U.S. dollar as the 

worldâ€™s leading currency for financial transactions.  For example, the global financial 

crisis highlighted the extent of borrowing and lending in U.S. dollars by foreign financial 

institutions.  When these institutions came under pressure, their actions contributed to the 

strains in both foreign and domestic dollar funding markets.  To achieve financial 

stability domestically and maintain the flow of credit to American households and 

businesses, we took action.  Importantly, we developed swap facilities with central banks 

in countries that represented major financial markets or trading centers in order to 

facilitate the provision of dollar liquidity to these markets.   

We did so in recognition of the scope of dollar markets and dollar-denominated 

transactions outside of our country, the benefits they provide to U.S. households and 

firms, and the adverse consequences to our financial markets if these centers lose access 

to dollar liquidity.  We have continued to maintain swap facilities with a number of 

                                                 
19 Bernanke (2014), Fischer (2014), and Tarullo (2014) also discuss concrete steps that U.S. authorities 
have taken in the past five years to implement financial reform of large financial institutions (including 
introducing a systematic framework for stress-testing, stronger capital and liquidity requirements, and 
progress on resolution mechanisms for failed institutions), of financial market infrastructures, and in short-
term funding markets.
