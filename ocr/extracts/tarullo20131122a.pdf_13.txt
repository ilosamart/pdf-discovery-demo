macroprudential perspective that forces firms to internalize the tail-event financial stability risks 

associated with SFT matched books.   

Policy Options 

There are two kinds of policy options that can be considered, individually or together, in 

responding to the financial stability vulnerabilities inherent in firms with large amounts of short-

term wholesale funding--whether loaned, borrowed, or both.  The first would impose a 

regulatory charge calculated by reference to reliance on SFTs and other forms of short-term 

wholesale funding, whether the firm uses that funding to finance inventory or an SFT matched 

book.  The second would directly increase the very low charges under current and pending 

regulatory standards attracted by SFT matched books. 

 Among the first set of options, the idea that seems most promising is to tie capital and 

liquidity standards together by requiring higher levels of capital for large firms that substantially 

rely on short-term wholesale funding.  The additional capital requirement would be calculated by 

reference to a definition of short-term wholesale funding, such as total liabilities minus 

regulatory capital, insured deposits, and obligations with a remaining maturity of greater than a 

specified term.  There might be a kind of weighting system to take account of the specific risk 

characteristics of different forms of funding.  The capital requirement would then be added to the 

Tier 1 common equity requirement already mandated by the minimum capital, capital 

conservation buffer, and globally systemic bank surcharge standards.  However, this component 

of the Tier 1 common equity requirement would be calculated by reference to the liability side, 

rather than the asset side, of the firmâ€™s balance sheet. 

The rationale behind this policy option is that, while solid requirements are needed for 

both capital and liquidity, the relationship between the two also matters.  For example, a firm
