would be helpful to clearing members that are comparing test results across several CCPs 

and to regulators that are considering systemwide stability.  For example, there are likely 

some financial market stresses, such as rapid and significant increases in market 

volatility, that would be expected to have broad effects across financial markets and 

participants.  Coordinated stress tests could also help us better understand the 

macroprudential risks around liquidity that I discussed earlier.  Understanding the effect 

of such correlated stresses on a wide array of CCPs will be important for ensuring overall 

system resiliency.  Going forward, regulators will need to work collaboratively to ensure 

that stress tests are robust, informative, and appropriately comparable.       

Skin in the game   

A number of commentators have urged U.S. authorities to consider requiring 

CCPs to place significant amounts of their own loss-absorbing resources in front of the 

mutualized clearing fund or other financial resources provided by clearing members.  

These skin-in-the-game requirements are intended to create incentives for the owners of 

CCPs for careful consideration of new products for clearing, for conservative modeling 

of risks, and for robust default waterfalls and other resources to meet such risks as may 

materialize.9  The issue is a complex one, however, and a number of factors would need 

to be considered in formulating such a requirement.    

Recovery and resolution   

I have focused so far on what we can do to ensure that CCPs do not fail:  more 

transparency, enhanced stress testing, more robust capital and default waterfalls, stronger
