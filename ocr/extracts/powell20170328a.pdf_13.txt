Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed every January.  

This statement discusses the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory goals of 

maximum employment and price stability; it indicates that the Committee judges 

inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal 

Reserve’s statutory mandate.26  Transcripts of FOMC meetings are released to the public 

after a delay of about five years. 

Federal Reserve Board Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents contribute to the 

Federal Reserve’s transparency with frequent public speeches and other communications.  

I believe that support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution is sustained by the 

public expression of our diverse views.27 

These communications with Congress and the public are critical parts of the 

Federal Reserve’s institutional accountability and transparency, and are essential 

complements to its independence.  It is important that Federal Reserve officials regularly 

demonstrate that the Fed has been appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  

Transparency can also make monetary policy more effective by helping to guide the 

public’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.
