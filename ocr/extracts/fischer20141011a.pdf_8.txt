Turning to more recent events, I’ll next assess the effects of the Fed’s quantitative 

easing and other unconventional monetary policies pursued by central banks in advanced 

economies since 2008.   

Effects of Monetary Accommodation since the Global Financial Crisis 

During the period of extensive monetary accommodation after the 2007-08 global 

financial crisis, there has been heightened concern about the international spillovers of 

monetary policies--and of ours, in particular.  Some EME critics argued that U.S. policy 

accommodation contributed to a surge of capital inflows and excessive credit growth in 

their economies, creating risks of financial instability.  But, as time wore on, most EMEs 

seemed glad to receive those flows.   

There is little doubt that the aggressive actions the Federal Reserve took to 

mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis significantly affected asset prices at 

home and abroad as well as international capital flows.  While the Fed’s asset purchases 

were composed wholly of Treasury, agency, and agency-backed securities (for legal and 

practical reasons), the program also aimed to boost the prices of riskier assets and ease 

financial conditions for the private sector.9  (And this is what the textbooks say the 

program should have done.)  The preponderance of evidence suggests that the Fed’s asset 

purchases raised the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes as well as those 

of riskier assets.10
