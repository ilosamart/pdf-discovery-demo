central banks.  Although usage is currently very low, these facilities represent an 

important backstop in the event of a resurgence in global financial tensions.   

But I should caution that the responsibility of the Fed is not unbounded.  My 

teacher Charles Kindleberger argued that stability of the international financial system 

could best be supported by the leadership of a financial hegemon or a global central 

bank.20  But I should be clear that the U.S. Federal Reserve System is not that bank.  Our 

mandate, like that of virtually all central banks, focuses on domestic objectives.  As I 

have described, to meet those domestic objectives, we must recognize the effect of our 

actions abroad, and, by meeting those domestic objectives, we best minimize the negative 

spillovers we have to the global economy.  And because the dollar features so 

prominently in international transactions, we must be mindful that our markets extend 

beyond our borders and take precautions, as we have done before, to provide liquidity 

when necessary.   

That said, the world is not without other resources to guard against adverse 

economic and financial spillovers.  Most obviously, the International Monetary Fund has 

played and will continue to play a critical role in providing liquidity and financial support 

to its member countries.  In the United States, we are working to ensure that our financial 

institutions and other market participants are prepared for the normalization of monetary 

policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates.  It is equally important that 

individuals, businesses, and institutions around the world do the same.  For our part, the 

Federal Reserve will promote a smooth transition by communicating our assessment of 

the economy and our policy intentions as clearly as possible.
