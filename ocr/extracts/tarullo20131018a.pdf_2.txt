Observing the five-year anniversaries of various key moments in the financial crisis 

throughout 2013 cannot but prompt us to step back and evaluate the effectiveness of the 

regulatory reform efforts that followed.  This week, which marks five years since the U.S. 

government launched the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), is a particularly appropriate 

moment to hold this conference on the resolution of systemically important financial institutions 

(SIFIs).  The TARP’s extension of unprecedented capital support to many of the largest U.S. 

banks reflected the view of government officials that the failure of these firms would have posed 

a grave threat to the financial system.  The turmoil that followed the failure of Lehman and the 

decision to rescue AIG each, in their way, underscored the absence of a third alternative to the 

options of bailout or disruptive bankruptcy.  The creation of such an alternative, included as the 

Orderly Liquidation Authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act, was a key part of the reforms. 

In fact, the emergence of a growing consensus around the key elements of a credible 

resolution mechanism, and the work to engraft those elements into appropriate statutory and 

administrative frameworks, is one of the more unheralded—if still in progress—successes of the 

post-crisis regulatory response.  Here in the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) has been doing path-breaking work to build out the statutory provisions of 

the Dodd-Frank orderly liquidation authority.  Internationally, the Financial Stability Board 

(FSB) has elaborated a set of principles to guide the development of resolution mechanisms 

globally.1  And, throughout both processes, there has been fruitful interaction among the official 

sector, academics, and market participants. 

                                                 
1 In November 2011, the Financial Stability Board adopted Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for 
Financial Institutions, a new international standard that sets out the core elements of an effective special resolution 
regime for systemically significant financial firms (www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104cc.pdf).
