Good afternoon.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in this inaugural 

conference on community banking research and policy.  By way of introduction, I have spent 

most of my career in the private sector, including many years as an investor in small and 

medium-size companies.  Although I have never worked in a community bank, I have been a 

customer, and I know from personal experience the special skills that these institutions bring to 

their customers.  Community banks are a crucial part of our economy and the fabric of our 

society.    

My colleagues on the Board of Governors and I understand the value of having a diverse 

financial system that includes a large and vibrant contingent of community banks.  By fostering 

the economic health and vitality of local communities throughout the country, community banks 

play a central role in our national economy.  One important aspect of that role is to serve as a 

primary source of credit for the small businesses that are responsible for creating a substantial 

proportion of all new jobs.  A thriving community banking sector is essential to sustaining our 

ongoing economic recovery. 

Community banks have faced significant challenges in recent years, as our nation has 

endured a major financial crisis and recession, followed by a painfully slow recovery.  To make 

matters worse, community bankers, who played no part in causing the financial crisis, have been 

forced to fight to ensure that they are not swept up in a torrent of costly new regulations that 

were intended to address problems at those very large banks that did contribute to the crisis.  The 

Federal Reserve will continue to be alert to the possible unintended consequences of regulatory 

policies, and we welcome input from community bankers as we develop and implement those 

policies.
