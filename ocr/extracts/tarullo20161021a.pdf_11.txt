In contrast, my taxonomy would categorize regulation as targeted at a specific institution 

when it applies because of the particular characteristics of that institution, not simply because of 

its business model (or models).  Thus, the designation of a nonbanking firm as systemically 

important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) under the authority of the Dodd-

Frank Act is made because the size, portfolios, activities, and other characteristics of the specific 

firm are found on an individualized basis to meet the statutory standard of nonbank systemic 

importance.  Similarly, the determination of the capital surcharge applicable to SIFIs is made on 

the basis of the particular “systemic footprint” of the firm. 

Finally, a transaction-based requirement is one that would be binding on anyone involved 

in such a transaction (with perhaps some de minimis exceptions), regardless of their status as a 

particular kind of financial intermediary.  An example would be the minimum margining 

requirements on securities financing transactions that have been agreed to at the Financial 

Stability Board (FSB), which the Federal Reserve will be proposing through a rulemaking next 

year. 

Of course, a particular firm may be a target under two, or possibly all three, approaches.  

But it is important to identify clearly why a regulation is deemed necessary and, accordingly, 

how it should be targeted.  In the framework I have set forth, for example, institution-specific 

measures may be thought of as those needed to protect financial stability even though a firm is 

already subject to business model regulation.  And a transaction-based measure may be thought 

of as one needed to protect financial stability regardless of whether all entities that might engage 

in such a transaction need to be regulated because of the risks associated with their business 

models.
