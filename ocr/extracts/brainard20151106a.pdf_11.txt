investors and policymakers around the world has been on China, where the buildup of

The feedback loop between market expectations of divergence between the

further weakening of foreign growth could pose downside risks to the U.S. outlook.  

Under normal circumstances, policy in the United States could adjust to signs that 

spillovers from developments abroad were affecting activity in the United States.  But 

with policy rates in the United States at the lower bound, the ability to offset spillovers 

from adverse developments in foreign economies with conventional policy is constrained,

countries that have helped monetary policy escape the constraints of the zero lower 

bound.  Just as it appears that unconventional monetary policy can provide 

accommodation domestically similar to conventional monetary policy, so too it appears 

that cross-borders spillovers work through the same channels.  Nonetheless, the 

discontinuity of discrete policy changes around the zero lower bound can amplify the
