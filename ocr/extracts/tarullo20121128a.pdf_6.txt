The Shift in Foreign Bank Activities 

Although foreign banks expanded steadily in the United States during the 1970s, 1980s, 

and 1990s, their activities here posed limited risks to overall U.S. financial stability.  Throughout 

this period, the U.S. operations of foreign banks were largely net recipients of funding from their 

parents and generally engaged in traditional lending to home-country and U.S. clients.

  U.S. 

branches and agencies of foreign banks held large amounts of cash during the 1980s and ’90s, in 

part to meet asset-maintenance and asset-pledge requirements put in place by regulators.  Their 

cash-to-third-party liability ratio from the mid-1980s through the late 1990s generally ranged 

between 25 percent and 30 percent. 

The U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that borrowed from their parents and 

lent those funds in the United States (“lending branches”) held roughly 60 percent of all foreign 

bank branch and agency assets in the United States during the 1980s and ’90s.  Commercial and 

industrial lending continued to account for a large part of foreign bank branch and agency 

balance sheets through the 1990s.

financial crisis.  Reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased significantly.  

Many foreign banks shifted from the “lending branch” model to a “funding branch” model, in 

which U.S. branches of foreign banks were borrowing large amounts of U.S. dollars to upstream 

to their parents.  These “funding branches” went from holding 40 percent of foreign bank branch
