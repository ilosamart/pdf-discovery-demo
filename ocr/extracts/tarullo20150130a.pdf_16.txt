Conclusion 

In a basic sense, the imperative of a macroprudential policy perspective means taking 

account of system-wide effects as financial regulation is developed and implemented.  But as is 

the case with traditional microprudential policy, agreement at this high level does not necessarily 

assure agreement on the priorities for regulatory attention, much less the specific regulations that 

should be adopted.  Nor can even the best-conceived macroprudential policies compensate 

totally for the risks created by key macroeconomic or financial conditions.  It should, however, 

force us all to think about issues like arbitrage, correlated risks and responses, and externalities 

in a more explicit and regular fashion than was evident in pre-crisis practice.  And even as 

policymakers try to move forward with a practical agenda to incorporate macroprudential 

concerns in their programs, it is important that the academics and policy researchers represented 

by this audience continue to advance this still fledgling sub-discipline through both theoretical 

and empirical work.
