I think it would be sensible for the banking agencies to consider altering the enhanced 

supplementary leverage ratio requirement so that it would be set with an eye toward the risk-

based surcharge.  One, but certainly not the only, way to do this would be for the enhanced 

supplemental leverage ratio to be 1 percent for the firms with a 1 percent to 1-½ percent risk-

based surcharge, 1-½ percent for those with a 2 percent or 2-½ percent risk-based surcharge, and 

2 percent for those at 3 percent or above.    

An alternative approach to mitigating the distortionary effects of the leverage ratio 

requirements is to exclude certain “riskless” assets from the denominator.  Some central bankers 

around the world have been arguing to exclude central bank reserves from the leverage ratio 

denominator, on the ground that they are “safe” and that including them may make monetary 

policy harder to execute in a period of unusually large central bank balance sheets.  But this 

would defeat the whole purpose of a leverage ratio, which is to place a cap on total leverage, no 

matter what the assets on the other side of the balance sheet may be.  Cash holdings, for 

example, are not excluded.  This proposal would also create a classic slippery slope risk, which 

was illustrated during a discussion in which I participated last year.  When a central banker 

raised the idea of excluding reserves, a finance ministry official mused aloud that perhaps 

sovereign debt should also be excluded.   

Stress Testing 

Raising the minimum ratios in leverage and risk-based capital standards, requiring that 

qualifying regulatory capital be truly loss absorbing, and setting higher requirements for the most 

systemically important banks have been important steps toward the goal of a well-capitalized, 

and thus safer, financial system.  But the stress testing system begun during the crisis, and 

continually refined since, has been the key innovation in capital regulation and supervision and
