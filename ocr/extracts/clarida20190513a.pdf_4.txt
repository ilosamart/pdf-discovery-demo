downturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained 

inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment 

conditions.6  However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, 

of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, it is all the 

more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels 

consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 

Activities and Timeline for the Review 

Our monetary policy review will have several components.8  The Board and the 

Reserve Banks are hosting Fed Listens events—such as this one in Boston—in which we 

are hearing from, among others, business and labor leaders, community development 

advocates, and academics.  Next month, we are holding a System research conference at 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with speakers and panelists from outside the Fed.  

                                                 
6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary 
policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such 
a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and 
Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a 
central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the 
adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary 
policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to 
shocks. 
7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others 
(2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the 
precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review 
the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of 
inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the 
level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in 
these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low 
and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in 
determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations.
