field, which is important given the global nature of derivatives markets.  Regulatory 

authorities in participating countries are now in the process of developing margin rules 

for noncleared derivatives in light of the international framework.     

The framework requires both financial firms and systemically important 

nonfinancial firms that trade derivatives to collect both variation margin and initial 

margin, as is the case for centrally cleared derivatives.  The initial margin requirements 

represent a significant change to existing market practice and will undoubtedly impose 

some costs on market participants.  As originally proposed, the new framework would 

have required most market participants to collect initial margin from the first dollar of 

exposure.  The International Swap Dealers Association estimated that roughly an 

additional $1.7 trillion in initial margin would have been required globally.12  In light of 

this concern, the framework was released for public consultation on two separate 

occasions and the Basel Committee and IOSCO conducted a detailed impact study to 

determine the potential liquidity costs of the new requirements.13 

The final version of the framework addressed these concerns by allowing firms to 

begin collecting initial margin only as potential future credit exposures rise above 

$65 million for a particular counterparty.  According to the impact study, this revision 

reduced the estimated global liquidity requirement from roughly $2.3 trillion to 

$900 billion.14  The result is a margin regime that will protect the financial system from
