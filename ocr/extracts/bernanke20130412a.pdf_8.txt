the Housing and Community Development Cabinet, which is composed of 

representatives from city departments from housing and transportation to health, family 

services, and economic development.  The cabinet will be responsible for identifying 

neighborhoods for coordinated investment across sectors. 

Perhaps one of the most promising new partners in community development is the 

health-care sector.  Factors such as educational attainment, income, access to healthy 

food, and the safety of a neighborhood tend to correlate with individual health outcomes 

in that neighborhood.  Because these factors are linked to economic health as well as 

physical health, health-care professionals and community development organizations are 

seeing new opportunities for cooperation in low-income communities.  For example, 

public health specialists and housing leaders are working together in Seattle to reduce the 

incidence in low-income homes of allergens that can cause or aggravate asthma.  Because 

asthma results in a significant loss of school days and billions of dollars in treatment 

costs, it is easy to see that these efforts have the potential to improve not only health, but 

educational and economic outcomes as well.

Beyond complementary interests with community development organizations, 

health professionals offer an important set of skills and tools, including unique data sets 

and sophisticated evaluation techniques.  For example, using data from 38 children’s 

hospitals, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute found an association 

between rates of foreclosures and poor health in children, including the incidence of
