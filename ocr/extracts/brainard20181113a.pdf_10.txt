information, on the other.  To some degree, the opacity of AI products can be seen as an 

extension of this balancing.  But AI can introduce additional complexity because many AI tools 

and models develop analysis, arrive at conclusions, or recommend decisions that may be hard to 

explain.  For instance, some AI approaches are able to identify patterns that were previously 

unidentified and are intuitively quite hard to grasp.  Depending on what algorithms are used, it is 

possible that no one, including the algorithm’s creators, can easily explain why the model 

generated the results that it did.  

The challenge of explainability can translate into a higher level of uncertainty about the 

suitability of an AI approach, all else equal.  So how does, or even can, a firm assess the use of 

an approach it might not fully understand?  To a large degree, this will depend on the capacity in 

which AI is used and the risks presented.  One area where the risks may be particularly acute is 

the consumer space generally, and consumer lending in particular, where transparency is integral 

to avoiding discrimination and other unfair outcomes, as well as meeting disclosure 

obligations.19  Let me turn briefly to this topic. 

The potential for the application of AI tools to result in new benefits to consumers is 

garnering a lot of attention.  The opportunity to access services through innovative channels or 

processes can be a potent way to advance financial inclusion.20  Consider, for instance, consumer 

credit scoring.  There are longstanding and well-documented concerns that many consumers are 

                                                 
19 In a 2017 request for public comment, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection noted that alternative 
modeling techniques may offer consumer benefits, such as greater credit access, enhanced creditworthiness 
predictions, lower costs, and better service and convenience, but also highlighted consumer risks, such as privacy 
concerns, data quality issues, loss of the ability to correct errors, and discrimination. See Bureau of Consumer 
Financial Protection, “Request for Information Regarding Use of Alternative Data and Modeling Techniques in the 
Credit Process,” (Washington: Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, February 14, 2017),
