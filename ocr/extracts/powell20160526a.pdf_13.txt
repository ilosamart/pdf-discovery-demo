over time, to unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth.  Macroprudential and 

other supervisory policies are designed to reduce both the likelihood of such an outcome 

and the severity of the consequences if it does occur.  But it is not certain that these tools 

would prove adequate in a financial system in which much intermediation takes place 

outside the regulated banking sector.  Thus, developments along these lines could 

ultimately present a difficult set of tradeoffs for monetary policy.16 

Conclusion 

To wrap up, with the support of monetary accommodation, our economy has 

made substantial progress.  My view is that a continued gradual return to more normal 

monetary policy settings will give us the best chance to continue to make up lost ground.
