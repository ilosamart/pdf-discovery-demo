On the other side of the debate, fintech companies are concerned that banks could use 

their control over consumer data access in the context of bilateral contracts with data aggregators 

to leverage their position in order to impede competition elsewhere in the stack.  This argument 

about access and competition echoes similar concerns in the smartphone arena.24  

Further, third-party developers argue that open standards for data access can help banks 

meet consumers’ expectations for mobile banking by providing access to the fintech apps that 

best serve their needs.  The relatively open architecture of the iPhone platform means that Apple 

profits from outside developers’ products without having to design or invest in them directly.  

For instance, Apple didn’t include a home-grown mapping app during the first few years of the 

iPhone.25  Instead, it relied on Google to provide that important function for its smartphones 

before trying to build its own mapping tool--a process that took a number of iterations before 

getting it right.  Open platform strategies may mean that banks can essentially outsource product 

development to fintech firms.26  This could be a boon--particularly for small community banks 

                                                           
24 When the iPhone first launched, for instance, one phone provider paid a premium for exclusive access to the 
smartphone. This meant that, for several years, consumers that wanted the iPhone also had to enter relationships 
with the only Internet service provider platform that offered the phone.  See, e.g., Saul Hansell, “Why AT&T Wants 
to Keep the iPhone Away from Verizon,” New York Times, April 22, 2009, 
https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/why-att-wants-to-keep-the-iphone-away-from-verizon/ (“AT&T is paying 
Apple an unusually high subsidy on top of the $199 and $299 paid by iPhone buyers. But it appears to be getting 
quite a return on that investment.”) At the same time, Apple has used its own iPhone platform to affect the 
development of products further up the stack.  While much of the iPhone is an open platform for third-party 
developers, developers do not have access to the iPhone’s secure element and Near Field Communication (NFC) 
antenna--key components of digital wallet technologies.  This means that Apple Pay is the only “tap-to-pay” NFC 
digital wallet available for iPhones--and that Apple Pay competitors, like Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are unable 
to access 40 percent of the smartphones in the United States. See, e.g., Philip Elmer-DeWitt, “About Apple’s 40% 
Share of the U.S. Smartphone Market,” Fortune, February 11, 2016, http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/apple-iphone-
ios-share/.  When a group of Australia’s largest banks recently petitioned the country’s antitrust authority to allow 
them to band together to require Apple to unlock access to the NFC antenna, for use by their digital wallets, their 
request was denied.  See, e.g., Simon Sharwood, “Banking Group Denied Access to iPhones’ NFC Chips for 
alt.Apple.Pay,” Register, April 3, 2017,

26 For example, small business lender Kabbage, Inc. has entered agreements with large banks, where Kabbage 
licenses its data analysis-heavy customer acquisition platform to banking partners who then go on to originate, fund, 
and service the underlying loans. See, e.g., Kabbage Inc., “Kabbage and Santander UK Partner to Accelerate SMB
