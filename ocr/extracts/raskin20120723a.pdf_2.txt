Thank you for inviting me to the Graduate School of Banking at Colorado to share some 

thoughts about your future and our common work.  First, I want to offer my sincere condolences 

to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the terrible shooting in Aurora last week and 

wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.  This is a terrible tragedy and everyone across 

the country shares in the shock and sadness that the people of Colorado are experiencing.

road just doesn’t seem to take us where we want to go fast enough.  Suddenly, the low road can

restraints and incentives—the guard rails and HOV lanes, if you will—of  the regulatory system 

to promote use of the high road and warn bankers off of the low roads where the rocks are 

falling, the curves are sharp, and many calamitous accidents happen.       

But this is not a task that the regulators can accomplish alone--any more than police 

officers can stop cell-phone use on the roads without the active participation of motorists, 

parents, telephone companies, the media, and so on.  New laws and regulations may lay the
