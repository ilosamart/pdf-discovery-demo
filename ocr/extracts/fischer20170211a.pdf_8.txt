So the expectations of decisionmakers, be they households, firms, or investors, 

are at the center of how monetary policy works--both in the real world and in FRB/US.  

At the same time, the economy is subject to economic shocks that perturb the plans of 

economic agents and alter their expectations, as well as the plans and expectations of 

policymakers.  The role of monetary policymakers is to respond to economic shocks in as 

efficient a manner as possible, and thereby influence economic outcomes and 

expectations, in order to achieve the central bank’s assigned goals.  Indeed, the conduct 

of monetary policy is often described as a matter of expectations management.14 

How might policymakers best respond to economic disturbances and influence 

expectations in order to achieve their policy objectives?  To help FOMC policymakers 

answer that question, the Tealbook for each meeting provides monetary policy 

prescriptions from a variety of simple policy rules, including John Taylor’s famous rule 

(or family of rules).15  Economic conditions and the outlook change from meeting to 

meeting, and, not surprisingly, the prescriptions of simple policy rules change with them. 

The Tealbook from the April 2011 meeting provides an example of the role of 

policy rules in the FOMC’s discussions.  The reason I focus on a meeting so long ago is 

that materials from FOMC meetings in 2011--including the transcripts and Tealbooks--

have recently been released to the public, following the usual five-year lag.16 

At the time of the April 2011 meeting, the federal funds rate had been near zero 

for almost 2-1/2 years; moreover, the FOMC had been indicating in its post-meeting

FOMC meetings in 2011 are available on the Board’s website at
