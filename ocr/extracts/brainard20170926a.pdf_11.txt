As we consider the long-term health of the U.S. economy, it is important to better 

understand the decade-long decline in aggregate labor force participation.  It is striking 

that in larger metro areas, the labor force participation rate for prime-age men has 

recently retraced much of the decline experienced during the recession, while in smaller 

metro and rural areas, the labor force participation rate remains well below its pre-

recession level, with only modest improvements of late.  The evidence increasingly 

suggests that much of the decline relates to a sustained decline in job opportunities for 

prime-age men, especially less-educated prime-age men, resulting in languishing wages 

relative to other groups.22  Indeed, it is notable that the striking decrease in labor force 

participation rates for nonmetro areas relative to large metro areas is highly concentrated 

among adults with no more than a high school education, who comprise a larger share of 

the prime-age population in nonmetro areas.  The labor force participation rate for adults 

with no more than a high school education has fallen to 72 percent in nonmetro areas--

about 3-1/2 percent below larger metro areas.23 

Although the precise causes of this decline are still not fully settled, one 

contributing factor is advancing automation and computerization.24  Another contributor 

is globalization.  For example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline 

in the employment and labor force attachment of prime-age men in areas of the country 

22 Most analysis suggests that at least half of the decline in the aggregate labor force participation rate since 
2007 is attributable to the aging of the population, with a significant portion of the decline that is not 
related to aging attributable to a longer-run decline in participation for younger individuals and prime-age 
men; for example, see Aaronson and others (2014) and the Council of Economic Advisors (2014).  For an 
overview of factors potentially attributable to the decline in labor force participation of prime-age men, see 
the Council of Economic Advisors (2016). 
23 These estimates are based on data from Weingarden (2017). 
24 For an overview of factors that have potentially impacted job opportunities for this group, see Autor 
(2010).  For examples of research on the recent labor market effects of technology and automation, see 
Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017).
