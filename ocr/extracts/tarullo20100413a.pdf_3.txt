There seems to be a fair consensus that the first two pillars of minimum prudential 

requirements and supervisory oversight need to be substantially improved in the wake of the 

crisis, including additional requirements based on the systemic role of firms.  The widespread 

acceptance of the need for a robust mechanism for resolving large financial institutions reflects a 

consensus that market discipline needs to be substantially increased in order to provide a genuine 

third pillar of the regulatory system.  Finally, support for structural measures such as the Volcker 

rule, mandatory central counterparties for certain derivatives trading, and limits on the growth of 

large financial institutions reveals a belief that even a strengthened three-pillar approach may not 

be enough to ensure financial stability.  These measures are, in effect, a proposed fourth 

regulatory pillar. 

The evolution of this multi-pillar approach is an understandable response to the severity 

of the financial crisis and ensuing recession.  There are differing, though not necessarily 

mutually exclusive, views as to what methods will be most effective in limiting the incidence and 

severity of future financial crises.  Thus, we should not be surprised to see a variety of regulatory 

measures in both agency actions and legislative reform packages.  Indeed, building a regulatory 

system with multiple instruments has advantages, since established regulatory mechanisms each 

have well-documented shortcomings, and the effectiveness of new ones will necessarily be 

uncertain.   

Yet some fear that the result will be an unwieldy system that will contain too many half 

measures, rather than a few strong regulatory mechanisms.  Others worry that the multiplicity of 

regulatory instruments will suppress not just behavior that is excessively risky in light of 

expected social returns, but also some socially desirable financial intermediation.  The result 

would be lower potential economic growth rates.  There is also concern that imposing additional
