consumer products is the first step in ensuring positive outcomes for consumers.  But 

consumers must also be equipped with the necessary quantitative and decisionmaking 

tools, and supported with the right information at the right time in order to make the best 

possible choices.  While much attention and many resources have been devoted to 

financial education, we still have surprisingly little information about the effectiveness of 

financial literacy efforts.  I hope that the dialog facilitated by this conference and future 

research will focus on understanding the best who, what, when, where, and why of 

financial education that will help American consumers make better decisions and achieve 

better financial futures.  The outcomes of this conference will help us develop the tools to 

do that.  I commend you for your efforts and wish each of you success here and in the 

future.
