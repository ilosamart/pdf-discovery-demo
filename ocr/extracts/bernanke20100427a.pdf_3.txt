Moreover, as debt and deficits grow, so will the associated interest payments, an 

obligation that in turn further increases projected deficits.  Unfortunately, we cannot grow 

our way out of this problem.  No credible forecast suggests that future rates of growth of 

the U.S. economy will be sufficient to close these deficits without significant changes to 

our fiscal policies. 

Among the primary forces putting upward pressure on the deficit are rapidly 

rising health-care costs and the aging of the U.S. population.  Federal spending for 

Medicare and Medicaid has increased substantially as a share of our national income over 

the past several decades, spurred both by the rising number of beneficiaries in these 

programs and by ongoing increases in spending per beneficiary.  Under policies in place 

prior to the recent enactment of the health-care bill, budget projections showed that 

spending for Medicare and Medicaid would roughly double as a share of national income 

over the next two decades and would continue to rise significantly further in subsequent 

years.  At this point, the effects of the recent legislation on federal health-care spending 

over the long term are uncertain, in part because they depend importantly on 

implementation.  But we do know that continued increases in health-care costs at the rate 

seen in recent decades, together with the aging of the population, would put enormous 

pressures on the federal budget in coming years.  Controlling health-care costs while still 

providing high-quality care to those who need it will be critical not only for budgetary 

reasons, but for maintaining the dynamism of the broader economy as well.  

The aging of the U.S. population will also strain the Social Security program, as 

the number of individuals expected to be working and paying taxes into the system is 

rising more slowly than the number of people projected to be receiving benefits.  This
