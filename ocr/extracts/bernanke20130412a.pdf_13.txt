given a $2,000 grant as seed money so that they can return to their communities and 

immediately go to work.  More than 13,000 resident leaders have gone through the 

institute to date, and some cities have replicated the format to provide local training for 

residents.

  These and similar programs not only train leaders, but they also create 

networks, partnerships, and the opportunity to learn from each other. 

Conclusion 

In sum, community development is a complicated enterprise.  Neighborhoods and 

communities are complex organisms that will be resilient only if they are healthy along a 

number of interrelated dimensions, much as a human body cannot be healthy without 

adequate air, water, rest, and food.  But substantial coordination and dedication are 

needed to break through silos to simultaneously improve housing, connect residents to 

jobs, and help ensure access to adequate nutrition, health care, education, and day care.  

Moreover, each community has its own particular set of needs, which depend on local 

conditions and resources.  Accordingly, local leadership, together with a vision of what 

each community can be, is essential.   

With that in mind, I want to thank all of you here today for the role you play in 

bringing your skills in research and analysis to the important work of rebuilding lower-

income communities.  Community development leaders have no shortage of commitment 

to their goals, but with the insights you provide, together with the opportunities to learn 

from the experiences of other communities, they will be better prepared and thus more 

successful in meeting the very difficult challenges they face.  Thank you for being here.

 Salt Lake City has formed its own leadership institute based on this model and has trained hundreds of 

local residents.  In Seattle, training was provided in Vietnamese using translators and NeighborWorks staff.  

New Orleans, San Jose, and Charlotte have also begun to provide local leadership training for residents.
