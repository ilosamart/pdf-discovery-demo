To date, the default rate on leveraged loans has been at the low end of its 

historical range, and corporate credit conditions have been favorable, with low interest 

expenses and low expected default rates.  However, if spreads rise sharply or economic 

conditions deteriorate significantly, we could see downgrades, refinancing challenges, 

rising delinquencies and defaults, and losses to investors.  

It is thus particularly notable that the run-up in business debt occurred against a 

backdrop of generally elevated valuations (figure 10).  Even with the recent volatility in 

equity markets and the recent widening of corporate bond spreads, a range of asset prices 

remain high relative to historical benchmarks.  In particular, yields on high-yield 

corporate bonds relative to Treasury securities remain somewhat narrow on a historical 

basis despite recent increases.  Similarly, although they have moved up in recent months, 

spreads on leveraged loans remain in the low end of their range since the financial crisis, 

which is notable given the evidence of weakening protections.  Finally, capitalization 

rates on commercial real estate properties, which measure annual income relative to 

prices for recently transacted properties, have been low relative to Treasury yields.   

The generally high appetite for risk that we saw over the past two years makes the 

equity, corporate debt, and other asset markets more vulnerable to swings in market 

sentiment.  In addition to generating losses for investors, declines in valuations could 

make it more challenging for firms to obtain or extend financing--especially among risky, 

indebted firms--which in turn could be amplified by the high levels of risky corporate 

debt.
