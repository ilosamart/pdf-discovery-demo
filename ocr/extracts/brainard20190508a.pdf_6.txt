Another idea I would like to hear more about involves targeting the yield on 

specific securities so that once the short-term interest rates we traditionally target have hit 

zero, we might turn to targeting slightly longer-term interest rates—initially one-year 

interest rates, for example, and if more stimulus is needed, perhaps moving out the curve 

to two-year  rates.  Under this policy, the Federal Reserve would stand ready to use its 

balance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate, but unlike the asset purchases that were 

undertaken in the recent recession, there would be no specific commitments with regard 

to purchases of Treasury securities.  Similar to make-up policies, such an approach could 

help communicate publicly how long the Federal Reserve is planning to keep rates low.  

I should emphasize that these are just a few ideas; there may be other good ideas, 

and part of the process we are engaged in involves looking around for other ideas.  Most, 

if not all, of the ideas have both advantages and disadvantages, and we will have to 

consider them carefully as our review progresses.  Of course, we may find that the 

preferred approach is modest enhancements to the tools that proved their worth during 

the crisis.   

Listening 

Now, how does today’s event fit into all of this?  Just as the Federal Reserve Bank 

of Richmond is sponsoring today’s event with representatives of its local community, so 

too are other Reserve Banks sponsoring similar events.  We are making sure to hear from 

people across the country.  We will also hold a national-level conference in Chicago in 

June.  And, in addition to presentations from prominent outside experts, we made sure to 

add panels to hear from community organizations, training institutions, and other groups 

that can give us insights on how monetary policy is affecting Main Street.
