Also affecting decisions about investing in servicing are new approaches to 

servicer compensation under consideration by the FHFA.  Servicers currently receive the 

same compensation for loans that are up to date as they do for loans that are past due.  

Servicing fees significantly exceed the cost of the administrative tasks associated with 

loans that pay on time, but there is an expectation that servicers will stockpile some of 

this “excess profit” to cover the cost of servicing delinquent loans.  The problems 

associated with loan modifications and foreclosures clearly demonstrate that servicers 

failed to invest enough in their infrastructure to be able to handle the current level of 

delinquent loans.  Furthermore, this arrangement provides no incentive for servicers to 

take on loans that have a higher risk of going past due and incurring higher servicing 

costs.  With origination and servicing closely linked, this incentive results in less credit 

offered to borrowers who have weaker credit profiles. 

Moreover, servicers subject to regulatory capital requirements are likely to be 

affected by new international capital standards that change the capital treatment of the 

asset known as “mortgage servicing rights” that is created from servicing compensation.  

These new standards are expected to cap the amount of mortgage servicing rights that 

institutions can include in regulatory capital, which could lead institutions to seek to limit 

or reduce the amount of mortgage servicing rights they own.  This circumstance, in turn, 

could reduce the liquidity in the market for mortgage servicing rights and potentially 

drive their valuations down.  Thus, the final design of servicer compensation along with 

servicing requirements will factor into the capital allocated to the mortgage business 

generally and to the relative tightness of credit standards.
