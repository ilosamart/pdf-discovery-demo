of trade openness do not require large trade surpluses, by the way, only a willingness to 

engage with and integrate with the global economy.  Notably, Korea ran current account 

deficits through much of its “growth miracle” phase.        

A third important lesson that has come into sharper focus, and which was not 

fully appreciated by the Washington Consensus, involves the capacity to draw on 

economies of scale to accelerate the pace of technical progress and economic growth.  

Economies of scale refer to the efficiency gains that can be achieved in some industries 

when production is run at a very large scale.  These gains may arise because of the nature 

of the technologies involved--as, for example, in steel manufacturing.12  But in some 

cases they can also arise because of the need to develop a critical mass of skilled workers 

and specialized suppliers.  It is no coincidence that so many high-tech firms locate near 

each other in California’s Silicon Valley or North Carolina’s Research Triangle; these 

firms benefit from the ability to draw on sufficiently large pools of skilled labor and other 

resources, while sharing ideas and information in mutually beneficial ways.13  A single, 

isolated firm would not likely be as productive.  Thus, scale economies can arise in the 

development of knowledge centers, like research universities, or in the building of large-

scale infrastructure, like a national highway system.14  For example, India’s IT industry is 

clustered in certain regions, such as Bangalore, around some of the more successful and 

high-quality institutes of technology in the country.  Moreover, recent research suggests 

that the growth of information technology activity in India has increased returns to 

                                                            
12 In such cases we call them “natural monopolies.”  
13 This idea whereby economies of scale can be continuously exploited by the sharing of ideas and 
“learning-by-doing” is one source of what is called “endogenous growth” in the economics literature.  See, 
for example, Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988).  While the idea of “natural monopolies” was well understood 
at the time the Washington Consensus came out, the “endogenous growth” literature was in its infancy.   
14 See, for example, Barro (1990).
