We expect to release summaries of the “Fed Listens” events and to livestream the 

Chicago conference.  Building on the perspectives we hear and on staff analysis, the 

FOMC will conduct its own assessment of its monetary policy framework, beginning 

around the middle of the year.  We will share our conclusions with the public in the first 

half 2020. 

Concluding Thoughts 

The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it 

makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider 

ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has 

assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict 

our ultimate finding.  What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to 

our framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to 

achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today.
