Perhaps more importantly, the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds 

would help the public understand whether a shift in the calendar date, assuming that one 

is still included in the statement, reflects a change in the Committee’s economic outlook 

or, alternatively, a change in its view concerning the appropriate degree of 

accommodation.  Since monetary policy works in large part through the public’s 

perceptions of the FOMC’s systematic behavior, this distinction is critical.25 

Conclusion 

 The past few years have seen important changes in the FOMC’s 

communications--innovations that promote the Federal Reserve’s accountability to the 

public.  Beyond that, I believe better communication serves to improve the efficacy of 

monetary policy at a time when the FOMC faces constraints on its ability to provide 

appropriate support to the economic recovery through the federal funds rate, its 

traditional policy tool.  In my view, we’ve made progress, but much work remains to be 

done. 

                                                 
25 The FOMC could also, potentially, provide additional information pertaining to the economic conditions 
it would expect to justify a decision to stop, or scale back, its asset purchases.  However, this decision also 
depends on the Committee’s assessment of efficacy and costs--matters on which the Committee is still 
gaining experience.
