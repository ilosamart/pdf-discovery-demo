initiatives and government support enabling the emergence of new technologies in areas 

that include agriculture, chemicals, health care, and information technology.  A case that 

has been particularly well documented and closely studied is the development of hybrid 

seed corn in the United States during the first half of the 20th century.4  Two other 

examples of innovations that received critical federal support are gene splicing--federal 

R&D underwrote the techniques that opened up the field of genetic engineering--and the 

lithium-ion battery, which was developed by federally sponsored materials research in the 

1980s.  And recent research on the government’s so-called war on cancer, initiated by 

President Nixon in 1971, finds that the effort has produced a very high social rate of 

return, notwithstanding its failure to achieve its original, ambitious goal of eradicating the 

disease.5 

What about the present?  Is government support of R&D today at the “right” 

level?  This question is not easily answered; it involves not only difficult technical 

assessments, but also a number of value judgments about public priorities.  As 

background, however, a consideration of recent trends in expenditures on R&D in the 

United States and the rest of the world should be instructive.  In the United States, total 

R&D spending (both public and private) has been relatively stable over the past three 

decades, at roughly 2-1/2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).6  However, this 

apparent stability masks some important underlying trends.  First, since the 1970s, R&D 

spending by the federal government has trended down as a share of GDP, while the share

6 In 2010, total U.S. R&D spending as a share of GDP was estimated to be 2.8 percent (Battelle and R&D 
Magazine, 2010).  For earlier data, see National Science Foundation (2010), table 13.
