relationship with a supervised bank must not get in the way of his or her willingness and ability 

to make tough calls. 

At the end of the day, some regulatory failures may be inevitable.  Examiners are smart, 

well-trained, diligent, and conscientious.  They are committed to public service and take their 

responsibilities seriously.  But even the best examiners are no more prescient than the managers 

of the banks they oversee and cannot be expected to head off every problem or detect every risk.  

The risk management systems and functions that comprise those inner concentric circles must be 

the primary mechanisms for heading off problems and detecting risks before they grow.   

Unfortunately, there is no panacea to eliminating risk:  Even the combination of 

appropriately designed risk management tools and thorough supervision can not completely 

eliminate the risk of low-probability, high-impact events.   

While I realize this sounds somewhat pessimistic, in fact I am quite optimistic about 

examinersâ€™ ability to play a strong and effective role in a healthy banking system.  In that regard, 

let me return to the concentric circle model and describe what we should expect from bank 

supervisors in the outermost circle.   

One of the most important functions of supervisors in a healthy banking system is to set 

high standards through the establishment of policies and through the design of a strong 

supervisory program.  Of course we should be vigilant about avoiding policies and practices that 

add little value and impose great burdens on banks, and I can assure you that we take that 

responsibility seriously, especially as it regards community banks.  But we also should set the 

bar high when it comes to our expectations for acceptable bank risk management and business 

practices.  We should be--and I believe we are--tough but fair.
