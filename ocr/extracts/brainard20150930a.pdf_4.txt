required for managing cash flow, for purchasing or maintaining property or equipment, 

for building inventory, or for expanding operations.  Depending on the needs, firms may 

be interested in term loans, capital leases, lines of credit, or credit card loans.  The 

characteristics of a small business and the nature of its credit needs influence the type of 

lender that is best suited to meeting those needs. 

Community Banks and Small Business Lending 

Community banks have long been a primary source of credit for small businesses 

and today may continue to have the best business model for fulfilling many small 

business credit needs.4  But changing technology has led to increased competition in this 

product space from both larger banks and, in recent years, alternative lenders.   

Large banking organizations ramped up their small business lending between 

2003 and 2008.  Although they pulled back from this market segment in the wake of the 

financial crisis, their small loans to businesses have been gradually rising since 2011.  

Meanwhile, community banks experienced very modest growth in small loans to 

businesses during the pre-crisis period, followed by a decline from 2009 through 2013 

and a subsequent leveling-off.  Consequently, community banksâ€™ share of the dollar 

volume of outstanding small loans to businesses at commercial banks has declined over 

the past decade.5  Despite this decline, community banks continue to hold about 

50 percent of outstanding small business loans at commercial banks, far in excess of 

their 20 percent share of commercial banking assets and deposits.6

is either independent or part of a banking organization that also has less than $10 billion in assets. 
5 Small loans to businesses are loans to businesses with initial principal amounts of less than $1 million.

Condition and Income, also known as Call Reports, that banks file with the Federal Financial Institutions
