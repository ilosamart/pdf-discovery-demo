from the recent recession has been much more robust in urban areas than in rural areas of 

the country. 

When it comes to performance measures, rural community banks consistently 

outperform urban community banks with regard to return on assets (figure 6) and return 

on equity (figure 7).  This difference was particularly pronounced during the financial 

crisis, when profitability fell much more sharply at urban community banks than at rural 

community banks.  Looking at charge-off rates (figure 8), we see that they have been 

quite similar for the two types of community banks over most of the past 20 years, except 

for the period from 2008 to 2013, when rural community banks had lower charge-off 

rates than urban community banks.  

This data suggest that, despite facing a more challenging economic environment, 

rural community banks appear to be holding their own relative to urban community 

banks.    

Market-Level Trends for All Banks and Community Banks 

Now I would like to shift my focus from the banks themselves to the communities 

they serve by exploring whether access to banking services--provided by community or 

larger banks--has been declining in urban or rural areas of the country.  As of 2017, the 

average urban market was home to 18 community banks and just over 8 large banks, 

which represents a change from 21 community banks and 6 large banks in 1997 

(figure 9).  The average number of community banks per rural market has been 

remarkably stable over the past 20 years at right around 4, while the average number of 

large banks per rural market has increased from just under 1 to 1.4 (figure 10).  These
