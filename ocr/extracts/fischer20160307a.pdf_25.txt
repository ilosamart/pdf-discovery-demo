This analysis is in the spirit of James Tobin’s approach to monetary economics as 

was recently described by Solow (2004) and extended by Woodford (2010) to describe 

the role for financial intermediation shocks.  It also captures the work by B. Friedman, B. 

Bernanke, and A. Blinder in thinking about the role of credit and credit spreads in the 

transmission of monetary policy impulses. 

Open economy aspects are captured by the following equations:  The balance of 

payment is in equilibrium when net exports are compensated by capital flows of opposite 

sign.  Capital flows depend on the difference between the domestic interest rate and the 

foreign rate adjusted for depreciation:

,𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓�+ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 �𝑖𝑖 − 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 −

𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒
𝑒𝑒 
� = 0.    (7) 

 
Furthermore, the uncovered interest rate parity equates the rate of return on 

domestic assets, 𝑖𝑖, to the rate of return on foreign assets, 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 ,  plus future expected changes 

in the exchange rate,  𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒
𝑒𝑒

, and a residual risk premium component, 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅: 

 
 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 +

𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒
𝑒𝑒 

+ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅.                    (8)

Startz (2014); and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996).
