number of different surveys indicate that longer-term inflation expectations have 

remained stable even as recent readings on inflation have fallen.  If inflation expectations 

had not remained stable, I would be more concerned because consumer and business 

expectations about inflation can become self-fulfilling.   

Implications for Monetary Policy 

My own outlook for the economy and inflation is broadly consistent with the 

central tendency of the projections submitted by FOMC participants at the time of our 

June meeting.  Based on my outlook, I expect that it will be appropriate at some point 

later this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin 

normalizing monetary policy.  But I want to emphasize that the course of the economy 

and inflation remains highly uncertain, and unanticipated developments could delay or 

accelerate this first step.  We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued

inflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years.  

Let me also stress that this initial increase in the federal funds rate, whenever it 

occurs, will by itself have only a very small effect on the overall level of monetary 

accommodation provided by the Federal Reserve.  Because there are some factors, which 

I mentioned earlier, that continue to restrain the economic expansion, I currently 

anticipate that the appropriate pace of normalization will be gradual, and that monetary 

policy will need to be highly supportive of economic activity for quite some time.  The 

projections of most of my FOMC colleagues indicate that they have similar expectations 

for the likely path of the federal funds rate.  But, again, both the course of the economy 

and inflation are uncertain.  If progress toward our employment and inflation goals is
