explanations, the social costs of this situation are huge.  It just cannot be the case that foreclosure 

is preferable to modification--including reductions of principal--for a significant proportion of 

mortgages where the deadweight costs of foreclosure, including a distressed sale discount, are so 

high.  While some banks and other industry participants have stepped forward to increase the rate

servicers and ultimate holders of the mortgages will take this occasion not just to correct 

documentation flaws and to contest who should bear the losses of mortgages gone bad, but to 

invigorate the modification process. 

Next Steps Down the Reform Road 

I note that while last year's conference was called "Regulatory Reform at the Crossroads," 

this year's event is entitled "The Dodd-Frank Act and the Road Ahead for Financial Regulatory 

Reform."  The metaphor of a long road ahead following key decisions in Dodd-Frank is an apt 

one for the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies that will, over the next 15 to 20 

months, complete implementation of that bill through scores of regulations.  The metaphor also 

applies to elaboration and domestic implementation of the framework for Basel III that was 

agreed to internationally in September.   

Though we may no longer face a major crossroads, the federal banking agencies will 

certainly encounter numerous forks in the road we are travelling.  Choices will be presented 

during implementation of certain Dodd-Frank provisions that set a general direction for change, 

but do not mandate a precise route.  Others will be encountered as we continue the Basel III 

exercise, to which I will return in a moment.  Still other choices will doubtless be required as all 

the member agencies of the new Financial Stability Oversight Council evaluate and, potentially,
