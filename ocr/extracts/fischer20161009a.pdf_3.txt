to demand over the second half of the year and for GDP to increase in the neighborhood 

of 2-3/4 percent.2   

Household spending has been the main contributor to real GDP growth over the 

past four quarters, and, with solid gains in employment and household income and upbeat 

consumer sentiment, this sector should continue to support growth over the second half of 

the year.  In contrast, residential construction has cooled this year despite rising home 

prices and low interest rates.  Housing starts have been moving sideways, suggesting 

little pickup in construction over the near term.   

In addition, business investment spending has been weak, held down in part by 

declining activity in the energy sector, which has obviously been hard hit by the steep 

drop in oil prices.  The recent stabilization of rig counts in the United States suggests that 

this source of restraint on business investment may be coming to an end.  That said, 

business investment outside of the energy sector has been unusually soft for the past three 

quarters, and this weakness will bear close watching.  Perhaps investment is being held 

down as firms respond to the flat trajectories for manufacturing and exports, reflecting 

subdued foreign demand and the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014.  Another 

possibility could be that firms are reassessing the prospects for growth and profitability in 

an environment of weak productivity growth and are accordingly scaling back investment 

plans.  Notwithstanding these downside possibilities, I expect that business investment 

will pick up in the second half of the year as the drag from the oil sector wanes and as 

firms expand capacity to meet rising demand.
