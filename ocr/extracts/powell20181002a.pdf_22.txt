Persistence of Inflation

    Figure 5.  Evolution of Estimates of the Slope and Persistence
Parameters of the Phillips Curve

     Note:  Panels show estimates of coefficients B and C    from the equation Inflation(t) = -B Slack(t) +  C    Inflation(t-1) + Other(t), where Inflation is 
core inflation and Slack is the unemployment gap, both as in figure 3.  All data are annual, and each point is the estimate for a rolling 20−year 
sample ended at the date shown on the horizontal axis.  Shaded areas represent 70 percent confidence intervals.  The data are through 2017.
