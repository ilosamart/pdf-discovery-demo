force.  Moreover, the declines in the unemployment rate have been widespread across 

racial and ethnic minority groups, though gaps for African Americans and Hispanics 

relative to whites remain sizable.  At 3.9 percent, the overall unemployment rate is below 

the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its full employment level, u*, of 

4.4 percent.  That said, the participants’ median estimate of u* has been falling for 

several years as strong employment gains have not triggered a worrying rise in price 

inflation.  

In a welcome development, nominal wage growth is picking up, with most 

measures now running around 3 percent on an annual basis.  And, for the past couple of 

years, wage gains have been notably faster for lower-income workers.2  Aggregate wage 

gains are broadly in line with productivity growth and our 2 percent inflation objective, 

and they are consistent with a labor market that is operating in the vicinity of full 

employment.  They are not, at present, a source of upward, cost-push pressure on price 

inflation. 

With regard to labor supply, we have had a pickup in labor force participation 

among prime-age workers (those 25 to 54 years old) that is, at least for now, boosting the 

supply side of the economy.  The participation rate of prime-age workers has risen about 

1-1/2 percentage points over the past few years.  And participation in the job market may 

                                                 
2 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels can be calculated using data from the Current 
Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The Economic Policy Institute provides convenient 
tabulations of these data.  For data through 2017, see Economic Policy Institute (2018), State of Working 
America Data Library (Washington:  EPI, March), table (“Wages by Percentile”),
