Thank you very much for having me here at the Financial Services Roundtableâ€™s spring 

meeting.  I am pleased to speak with you all about our financial regulatory system: both the 

broad principles that have been directing my approach to evaluating the regulatory system, as 

well as cybersecurity, which is a topic of great import to financial system participants and their 

regulators. 

Efficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation 

As I have said before, we have an opportunity to improve the efficiency, transparency, 

and simplicity of regulation.  We have spent the past decade building out and standing up the 

post-crisis regulatory regime, and as a result we have made critical gains.  The financial system 

is undoubtedly stronger and safer.  We have robust capital and liquidity levels, an effective stress

if we identify rules that are not working as intended, we should make the necessary changes.  

With the benefit of hindsight and with the bulk of our work behind us, now is a natural and 

expected time to evaluate the effectiveness of that regime. 

Our efforts toward implementing those principles are underway.  Federal Reserve Board 

staff members continue the review that I have previously outlined.  The goal is to consider the 

effect of past regulatory initiatives on the resiliency of our financial system, on credit availability 

and economic growth, and more broadly, their costs and benefits.  I am confident that that review 

will reveal some clear ways that we can improve the core post-crisis reforms.  

Cybersecurity 

Let me now turn from regulation to supervision, and more specifically, to the topic of 

cybersecurity, which continues to be a high priority for the Federal Reserve.  The Federal
