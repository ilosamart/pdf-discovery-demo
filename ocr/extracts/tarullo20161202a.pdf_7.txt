resulting market confidence in, U.S. banks has allowed them to expand their lending, the growth 

of which has returned during the last couple of years to a pace similar to that in the pre-crisis, 

pre-bubble years.8 

 What accounts for this dramatic change in the position of the U.S. financial system?  

First, the crisis response by U.S. authorities was fairly quick and complete.  The resolute actions 

of the Bush Administration in late 2008 and the Obama Administration early in 2009 helped 

stabilize banks and begin their recovery in fairly short order.  Recapitalization proceeded 

quickly, even as the stress test compelled an early reckoning with actual and potential losses.  

The forceful monetary policy response, the liquidity programs of the Federal Reserve, and the 

FDIC’s guarantee of bank debt prevented the bottom from dropping out of the badly shaken 

financial system.  The emergency fiscal stimulus of 2009 helped prevent a downward spiral in 

the real economy from a Great Recession to another depression.  

Second, and of more relevance for the subject of this conference, was the regulatory 

reform program put in motion even before the crisis had ended.  This program has steadily 

strengthened the capital, liquidity, and risk management positions of large banks, with 

progressively more stringent measures applied to the most systemically important institutions. 

The new regulatory regime for large banks serves two important, complementary goals.  One is 

to ensure that the nation’s large financial institutions are sufficiently strong to continue to 

function effectively as intermediaries, lending to creditworthy businesses and households even in 

a period of substantial financial and economic stress.  If they cannot do so because, for example, 

their capital positions have been too weakened, the result could be a deepening of what may 

already be a serious recession.  The other goal is to address the too-big-to-fail problem.  When

in 2014, 6.5 percent in 2015, and 7.1 percent thus far in 2016.
