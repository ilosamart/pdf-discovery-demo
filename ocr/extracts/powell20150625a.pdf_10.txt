me to my third point.  We need a comprehensive way to think about planning.  The 

National Institute of Standards and Technology’s cybersecurity framework is one of 

many voluntary cybersecurity frameworks that provide a holistic, risk-based approach to 

planning.5   In addition to preventive measures, the framework identifies four additional 

core functions:  identify, detect, respond, and recover.  We can apply these four functions 

to securing the payment system. 

An important first step is to identify internal business processes and assets, as well 

as external threats.  You can’t protect yourself unless you understand how your business 

is structured.  This sounds simple enough, but an organization’s computer systems are 

often unexpectedly interconnected.  Some of the largest point-of-sale data breaches, for 

example, originate outside payment card systems.6  You should also keep up to date on 

cyber developments and gather information about threats from information sharing 

forums, including FS-ISAC, US-CERT, and the FBI’s InfraGard.  

Regardless of how well we identify and protect, we also need to plan for a 

potential attack.  To address this, the NIST framework calls for plans to detect, respond, 

and recover.  Victims are often not aware that they’ve been breached.  Did you know that 

last year the median amount of time it took to discover a breach was about 200 days?7  

Plans need to include methods to detect attacks.  You also need to have a response plan. 

If your point-of-sale system is compromised or your account records are stolen, do you 

know which law enforcement agencies you should work with?  You will be more
