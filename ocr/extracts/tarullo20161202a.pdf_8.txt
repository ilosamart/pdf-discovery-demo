some combination of the size, functions, portfolios, and interconnectedness of a financial 

institution are such as to make authorities fear that its failure could endanger the entire financial 

system, they will be tempted to rescue the firm through direct capital injections or indirect 

measures to strengthen its solvency.  Knowing this, other market actors will be willing to lend to 

that institution at a premium lower than its actual risks would suggest is warranted, an effect that 

is particularly apparent during periods of stress.   

Taking both these goals into account, the regulatory regime must aim for much greater 

resiliency in the large banks than in smaller ones, so that they can continue to function even 

under serious stress without solvency assistance from the government and, thus, avoid causing 

more harm to the economy.  But the regime must also be able to contemplate failure by a very 

large bank--that is, to plan for the possibility that a larger bank may become insolvent 

notwithstanding much greater ex ante resiliency.  The regime must promote market discipline 

and offset the moral hazard that comes if a bank and its creditors believe the government will 

have no real choice but to bail the bank out. 

 Much has been accomplished in the last six or seven years to build a regime that 

advances both these goals.  I want to highlight four of its elements: capital, liquidity, risk 

management, and resolution planning.  Capital is, of course, central to ensuring resiliency 

although, as I will explain shortly, the presence or absence of other regulatory requirements is 

relevant in setting minimum capital levels.  Because no single capital measure can capture all 

possible sources of loss, U.S. banking regulation has for three decades required both a leverage 

ratio and a risk-based capital requirement.  In responding to the crisis, we have applied a higher 

leverage ratio and stronger risk-based capital requirements, including a robust stress testing 

program to larger banks.
