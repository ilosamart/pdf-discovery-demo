It is a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of New York.  I will begin by 

briefly reviewing the outlook for the economy, and then turn to a discussion of financial 

stability.  My main subject today will be the profound transformation since the Global 

Financial Crisis in the Federal Reserve’s approach to monitoring and addressing financial 

stability.  Today marks the publication of the Board of Governors’ first Financial 

Stability Report.  Earlier this month, we published our first Supervision and Regulation 

Report.  Together, these reports contain a wealth of information on our approach to 

financial stability and to financial regulation more broadly.  By clearly and transparently 

explaining our policies, we aim to strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 

that enables the Fed to serve the needs of the American public.   

Outlook and Monetary Policy 

Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the job of promoting maximum 

employment and price stability.  I am pleased to say that our economy is now close to 

both of those objectives.  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49-year low, and many 

other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.  Inflation is near our 

2 percent target.  The economy is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent, well 

above most estimates of its longer-run trend.   

For seven years during the crisis and its painful aftermath, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) kept our policy interest rate unprecedentedly low--in fact, 

near zero--to support the economy as it struggled to recover.  The health of the economy 

gradually but steadily improved, and about three years ago the FOMC judged that the 

interests of households and businesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best 

served by such extraordinarily low rates.  We therefore began to raise our policy rate
