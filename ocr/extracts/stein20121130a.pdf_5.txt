based on analysts’ earnings expectations) remain high by historic standards.  This 

unusually large divergence in the costs of debt and equity--due in part to the cumulative 

effects of our LSAP policies--is likely to be one factor that makes debt-financed 

repurchases of equity attractive.   

Let me turn now from Treasury-based LSAPs to those involving MBS.  If there is 

to be any difference between the two, one necessary condition is that there is some form 

of market segmentation, so that buying MBS has a different effect on the constellation of 

credit-market rates than buying Treasury securities--in other words, it’s not all about just 

removing a certain amount of undifferentiated duration from the market.  Judging by 

what happened in the wake of the Committee’s policy announcement on September 13, 

this segmentation condition seems to be clearly satisfied--indeed, I would say 

surprisingly so.

  In particular, while nominal long-term Treasury yields were roughly 

unchanged on the day of the announcement, yields on MBS fell dramatically.  Moreover, 

although the pass-through to primary mortgage rates has been more gradual, it too has 

been significant to date.   According to Freddie Mac’s primary mortgage market survey, 

the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has come down by more than 20 basis points 

since the September announcement, and is now near historic lows. 

One way to say it is that, given the nature of market segmentation, MBS 

purchases appear to trade off of some amount of breadth of effect across markets for a 

more pronounced effect in a single market--namely, the mortgage market.  What, then, 

are the implications for the transmission mechanism?  Clearly, it depends on the 

sensitivity of different forms of spending to changes in rates.  If, per my previous
