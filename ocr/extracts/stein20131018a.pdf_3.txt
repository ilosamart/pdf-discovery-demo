that is, measures that can be adapted in response to changing economic or financial 

conditions.  At the risk of caricature, one can distinguish three schools of thought.  The 

first school is generally suspicious of any kind of time-varying lean, be it with 

macroprudential tools such as time-varying, countercyclical capital buffers or margin 

requirements, or with monetary policy.  This school emphasizes the difficulty of 

identifying emerging financial imbalances in real time.  It also points to the political-

economy and regulatory-arbitrage impediments that can frustrate the implementation of 

discretionary time-varying regulation.2 

 The second school is more comfortable with the idea of time-varying leans, but 

invokes what amounts to a separation principle: It takes the view that any financial-

stability-motivated leans should come largely, if not entirely, from time-variation in the 

application of regulatory and supervisory tools, while monetary policy should stick to its 

traditional dual-mandate objectives of fostering full employment and maintaining price 

stability. 

 The third school is more heterodox.  Like the first, it acknowledges that there are 

a variety of practical limitations associated with discretionary time-varying regulation, 

though the severity of these limitations may vary considerably across different countries, 

markets, and institutional arrangements.3  In cases where regulation can be effectively 

adjusted over time, doing so remains the preferred approach.  But in other situations, and 

especially when the imbalances in question are relatively pronounced or widespread
