utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a stop-start pattern that 

undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep inflation 

under control.  Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and 

nominal wages and prices spiraled upward as workers sought compensation for past price 

increases and as firms responded to accelerating labor costs with further increases in 

prices.  That wage-price spiral was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under 

Chairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s.   

Since then, the Federal Reserve has remained determined to avoid those mistakes 

and to keep inflation low and stable.  It will be important to closely monitor the state of 

longer-term inflation expectations to ensure that the Federal Reserve’s credibility, which 

has been built up over the past three decades, remains fully intact. 

The Outlook for the Real Economy 
 
 Turning now to the real economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) has been 

rising since mid-2009 and now exceeds its level just prior to the onset of the recession.  

While GDP growth during late 2009 and early 2010 was largely the result of inventory 

restocking and fiscal stimulus, private final sales growth has picked up over the past six 

months--an encouraging sign.  At the same time, measures of business sentiment have 

generally returned to pre-recession levels, factory output has been expanding apace, and 

the unemployment rate has dropped by a percentage point over the past few months. 

Real consumer spending--which had been rising at a brisk pace in the fall--slowed 

somewhat around the turn of the year, and measures of consumer sentiment declined in 

March.  Those developments may partly reflect the extent to which higher food and 

energy prices have sapped households’ purchasing power.  More generally, however, as
