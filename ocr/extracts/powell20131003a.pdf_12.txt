My fellow governors and I encourage community bankers to use all the available 

communication channels to share with us their insights and concerns regarding new and existing 

regulations.  And I promise that their voices will be heard in Washington when policy issues that 

may affect the ability of community banks to thrive are under consideration.  While community 

banks certainly face challenges, I do not see their future as bleak.  Community banks continue to 

do a good job of attracting core deposits, and those stable and relatively inexpensive deposits 

remain the most sought-after liability on bank balance sheets.  However, many of the asset 

classes that traditionally comprised much of community bank portfolios have faced increasing 

competition in recent decades from firms that operate at the national level.  As auto, mortgage, 

and credit card loans have become increasingly standardized, community banks have had to 

focus to a greater extent on small business and commercial real estate lending--products where 

community banks’ advantages in forming relationships with local borrowers are still important.  

These are not cheap or easy loans to make, and the loss of some traditional product lines has 

threatened the stability of some community banks.  It is incumbent on the Federal Reserve and 

other regulators to understand the challenges community banks face and to ensure that our 

regulatory policies do not exacerbate them. 

  I look forward to hearing from the community bankers who will be participating in the 

conference’s final session.  Thank you for your attention and for your participation in this 

inaugural community banking conference.  I would be happy to take some questions from the 

audience.
