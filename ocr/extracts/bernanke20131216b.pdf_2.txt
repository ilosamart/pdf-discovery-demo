I have been asked to close this ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 

signing of the Federal Reserve Act--the law that created the Federal Reserve--by looking 

ahead to the next century.  Given the well-known difficulties that economists have in 

forecasting even the next few quarters, I will happily point out one important advantage

to develop the innovative policies required to meet, in the words of the Federal Reserve 

Act, the “unusual and exigent circumstances” we confronted during the recent financial 

crisis.  If there is one thing on which I believe all of us here can agree, it is that the
