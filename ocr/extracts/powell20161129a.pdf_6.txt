More positively, our current recovery compares fairly well with those of other 

advanced economies (figure 7).  Output has increased faster, and unemployment has 

declined faster, in the United States than in other major advanced economies.  And the 

Fed’s challenges in getting inflation back up to 2 percent are similar to, but not as severe 

as, those faced by some other major monetary authorities.  

Turning to the near-term outlook, after a slow patch in the first half of this year, 

growth has clearly strengthened.  I expect that the economy will continue on its path of 

the last few years, with real GDP growth of about 2 percent, strong job gains, a tightening 

labor market, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent objective.  The main risks I 

see to that outlook are from abroad.  Growth and inflation are low around the world.  

With interest rates so low, we are not well positioned to respond to negative shocks, 

whatever the source.   

Longer-Run Challenges 

Productivity and Growth 

Let’s turn to longer-run challenges, and start by asking why growth has been so 

slow, and how fast we are likely to grow going forward.  This next slide shows the five-

year trailing average annual real GDP growth rate (figure 8).  By this measure, growth 

averaged about 3.2 percent annually through the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s.  But 

growth began to decline after 2000 and then nose-dived with the onset of the Global 

Financial Crisis in 2007 and the slow expansion that followed.  Since the financial crisis 

ended in 2009, forecasters have gradually reduced their estimates of long-run trend
