largest U.S. operations of foreign banks do not approach the size of our largest domestic 

financial institutions, it is striking that there are 23 foreign banks with at least $50 billion in 

assets in the United States--the threshold established by the Dodd-Frank Act for special 

prudential measures for domestic firms--compared with 25 U.S. firms.

Most notably, perhaps, five of the top-10 U.S. broker-dealers are owned by foreign 

banks.  Like their U.S.-owned counterparts, large foreign-owned U.S. broker-dealers were highly 

leveraged in the years leading up to the crisis.  Their reliance on short-term funding also 

increased, with much of the expansion of both U.S.-owned and foreign-owned U.S. broker-

dealer activities attributable to the growth in secured funding markets during the past 15 years.

Finally, we should note that one of the fundamental elements of the current approach--our 

ability, as host supervisors, to rely on the foreign bank to act as a source of strength to its U.S. 

operations--has come into question in the wake of the crisis.  The likelihood that some home-

country governments of significant international firms will backstop their banksâ€™ foreign 

operations in a crisis appears to have diminished.  It also appears that constraints have been 

placed on the ability of the home offices of some large international banks to provide support to 

their foreign operations.  The motivations behind these actions are not hard to understand and 

appreciate, but they do affect the supervisory terrain for host countries such as the United States.  

International and Domestic Regulatory Response 

Since the crisis, important changes have been made to strengthen international regulatory 

standards.  The Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks are big improvements, and the

 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2011). 

Sections 165 and 166 apply to all foreign banks with $50 billion or more in global consolidated assets and a U.S. 

banking presence of any size.  More than 100 foreign banks operating in the United States would meet this threshold 

today (source:  FR Y-7Q).  Whether such a bank with relatively small U.S. operations should be subject to the same 

prudential requirements as those with U.S. operations in excess of $50 billion is an open question.
