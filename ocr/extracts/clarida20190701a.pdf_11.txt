In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will examine 

additional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding.  During the crisis and its 

aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools 

deployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue.  But 

the review will reassess the case for these and other tools in light of more recent 

experience in other countries. 

The third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s 

communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?”  Our 

communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal 

Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting.  Over the past decade or so, 

the FOMC has enhanced its communication practices both to promote public 

understanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic 

accountability.  These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 

Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the 

principles and strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and 

quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, 

assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the 

uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.24

24 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from 
various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy 
Report.  With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC 
increased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables 
included, and extended the forecast horizon.  Because the SEP includes individual contributions of
