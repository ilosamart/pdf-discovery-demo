liquidation costs are borne by investors remaining in the fund.  If a decline in bond prices 

leads to sizable fund withdrawals, the first-mover advantage could accelerate 

redemptions and second-round price declines.  In addition, investors may perceive 

leveraged funds that experience stress as riskier, possibly becoming more inclined to 

redeem from these funds.  This situation could be worse than in the past if market 

liquidity deteriorates and dealers are less willing to buy and hold bonds in inventory to 

cushion the price decline induced by fire sales.  However, thanks to recent regulation and 

supervisory changes, including higher capital requirements and stress tests, leverage at 

the largest intermediaries is much reduced relative to pre-crisis norms--and, as a result, 

vulnerabilities from potential fire sale risks are less significant.  From this perspective, a 

small reduction in liquidity from regulatory changes--even if present, which is not 

obvious--may be a reasonable price to pay for greater safety.  I will now place changes in 

liquidity into the broader context of financial stability.    

Tradeoff between Liquidity and Regulations to Achieve a Safer Financial System 

It is possible that regulations aimed at correcting vulnerabilities in the financial 

system--like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, together with other factors--have altered 

the business model of dealer firms and, thus, liquidity.  While the evidence for a 

reduction in market liquidity is far from clear, let us for the moment accept this 

possibility and consider the potential effects on financial stability.   

Regulatory changes, even those that may have reduced market liquidity, likely 

have enhanced financial stability on balance.  Recent evidence indeed points in favor of 

enhanced financial stability.  Regulatory capital ratios for banks and insurance companies 

remain high, which, as previously mentioned, would mitigate fire sales and their effect on
