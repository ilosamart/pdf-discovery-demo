believe that all the regulatory agencies should complete as soon as possible the remaining 

rulemakings generated by Dodd-Frank and Basel III.  It is important that banks and other 

financial market actors know the rules that will govern capital standards, proprietary 

trading, mortgage lending, and other activities.  In fact, we should monitor whether these 

rules end up having significant unintended effects on credit availability and, if so, modify 

them in a manner consistent with basic aims of safety and soundness and consumer 

protection. 

On the other hand, I equally strongly believe that we would do the American 

public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural 

weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect 

the too-big-to-fail problem.  This is the major problem that remains, and I would suggest 

that additional reform measures be evaluated by reference to how effective they could be 

in solving it.
