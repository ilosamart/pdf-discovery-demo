The countercyclical capital buffer may enhance financial stability by building 

additional resilience at systemic banking institutions near the height of the credit cycle.  

However, it may prove to be less effective in leaning against credit growth, since, as 

credit booms progress, there is greater potential for capital to be relatively cheap, asset 

valuations to be inflated, and risk weights to be incorrect.  Moreover the countercyclical 

capital buffer has some practical limitations:  It applies to a subset of the U.S. banking 

system and is designed to act with a one-year lag.  It also cannot be used efficiently to 

target specific asset classes that appear frothy, a challenge I turn to next.  

Tool three:  Time-varying sector-specific tools 

The countercyclical buffer may be a relatively blunt tool for circumstances where 

the buildup of risk is highly concentrated in a particular sector.  This was, of course, the 

challenge U.S. policymakers faced early in the recent housing bubble, with home prices 

rising and capital markets developing the complicated, opaque securities built on 

subprime mortgages that would ultimately cause damage throughout the financial system. 

Indeed, property booms are perhaps the most common macroprudential challenge that 

have confronted financial authorities in advanced economies over the years, although 

macroprudential challenges have also surfaced in other sectors, such as the corporate 

lending boom that confronted Korea in the mid-to-late 1990s.   

In addition to time-varying broad macroprudential tools, such as countercyclical 

capital buffers and dynamic provisioning, many financial authorities have the authority to 

promulgate rules that target activity in a specific sector.  For instance, Swiss authorities 

activated, in early 2013, a countercyclical capital buffer that added 1 percentage point of 

capital requirement for direct and indirect mortgage-backed positions secured by Swiss 

residential property, and then increased this amount in 2014 to 2 percentage points.
