 Thank you, Nan, for that kind introduction, and thank you to President Mester of the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for inviting me to speak this evening. I am honored to be 

here and to support the mission that you and the Council for Economic Education have worked 

so hard to advance--that every student in America gets a strong, early start on their financial 

education.  

That mission is critical in its own right, but it also reflects the deeply held value of 

participation--of giving young people the chance to shape not just their own futures, but also the 

futures of their communities and their country. Because so much of the language of finance is 

couched in terms of metrics and rationality, we often forget that finance is something we never 

do alone. It is, by definition, a collaboration, which helps us work together to achieve common 

goals.   

The Federal Reserve is no exception. Tonight, I want to briefly discuss the role that 

participation plays in the Federal Reserveâ€™s work and outline one effort to solicit broad 

participation--an upcoming conference on stress tests, intended to make those tests more open, 

transparent, and effective. 

 Public institutions exist under a grant of trust from the people they serve, to pursue a 

specific policy goal. When the public holds an institution accountable for that grant, the 

institution becomes stronger. The Federal Reserve System we know today emerged through 

decades of legislation, public consultation, and debate--from the original Federal Reserve Act, 

which created the Federal Reserve System, to the Banking Act of 1935,1 which established the 

modern Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 

                                                           
1 Pub.L. No. 305 (1935).
