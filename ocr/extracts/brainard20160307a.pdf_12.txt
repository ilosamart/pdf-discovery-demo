the system, is estimated to range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, based on 

2013 data, over and above the 7 percent minimum and capital conservation buffers under 

Basel III.  Indeed, it appears that some institutions may have already reduced their 

systemic footprint in anticipation of these additional charges. 

Of course, the crisis starkly illustrated that what seem like thick capital cushions 

in good times can become uncomfortably thin in the face of financial stress.  Our 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress-testing framework is 

arguably our most powerful tool for ensuring that these capital buffers remain robust to a 

variety of possible shocks to the trading and banking book exposures of the large, 

interconnected banking organizations.  Therefore, as we work to fine-tune and strengthen 

this framework, I would hope to see the capital surcharge for systemic banking 

organizations integrated into CCAR to ensure robustness, even as adjustments might be 

made on other parameters of the framework. 

Although todayâ€™s greatly enhanced common equity capital requirements should 

materially reduce the probability that a large bank might fail in response to a severe 

economic downturn or financial stress, it is not enough to reduce the risks of failure.  In 

parallel, our supervisory and regulatory efforts are raising the bar on ensuring that the 

large, interconnected banking organizations have in place credible plans and preparations 

as well as properly calibrated and positioned liquidity and loss absorbing capacity to 

ensure failure can take place in an orderly manner.   

To that end, we have proposed a Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rule that contains 

a long-term debt requirement that is critical to the feasibility of bankruptcy for the 

systemic banking organizations.  It is a necessary counterpart to the Dodd-Frank Act
