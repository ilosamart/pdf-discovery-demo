Asset Maintenance
Effective date July 1997 Section 5020.1

Asset maintenance was originally developed as
a method of ensuring that, in the event of a
liquidation, sufficient assets would be available
to effect repayment to depositors and liability
holders. Although asset maintenance is not a
capital equivalent, branches under asset mainte-
nance have some of the characteristics of a
separately capitalized entity. In fact, in the early
stages of asset maintenance, ratios of 108 per-
cent and 105 percent were established to be
roughly equivalent to the then-prevailing capital
ratios of U.S. domestic banks.

Generally, asset maintenance is defined as the
maintenance of eligible assets in a branch in a
particular state, covering a specified percent-
age of a branch’s third party liabilities. The
asset maintenance calculation is determined by
dividing eligible assets by liabilities requiring
cover.

Asset maintenance is generally defined and
enforced by the licensing agency. Examiners
should consult the appropriate regulation of the
appropriate agency to define and calculate the
ratio. Asset maintenance may also be imposed
by regulators through the issuance of supervi-
sory action. The supervisory imposition of asset
maintenance has significant effects on the branch
depending upon the percentage imposed. When
imposed at levels above 100 percent, a branch
must maintain a net due to related parties
position at all times. This effectively prevents
the branch from providing net funding to the
head office or other related offices. Asset main-
tenance levels below 100 percent would have
the effect of limiting the net due from related
parties position.

Asset maintenance requirements will differ by
state. Some states do not require coverage for all
third party liabilities booked at the branch (e.g.
IBF deposits). Therefore, even though a branch
meets the state’s asset maintenance require-
ments, the branch may still be in a net due from
affiliates position. In the event of a financially
weak FBO, regulators may consider expanding
the asset maintenance requirements to further
define eligible assets and liabilities to ensure
adequate coverage of all third party deposits.

State licensing authorities may impose asset
maintenance as a requirement of licensure within
that state. The FDIC imposes asset maintenance
as a requirement for receiving deposit insurance.

Asset maintenance may also be imposed at
individual branches or FBO offices as a form of

supervisory action for the U.S. operations of a
foreign banking organization. This action may
relate to supervisory concerns raised in deter-
mining the financial strength of the FBO, includ-
ing circumstances in the home country that
could adversely affect the FBO’s U.S. opera-
tions. Asset maintenance, in these instances,
may be necessary, even though the U.S. opera-
tions are in satisfactory condition.

As a result of statute, regulation, or supervi-
sory agreement, special requirements and guide-
lines for determining the amount of eligible
assets and calculating the asset maintenance
percentage may be required by the appropriate
regulatory agency. These requirements will
necessitate the maintenance of specific records
at the branch. A branch under asset maintenance
will also be required to periodically report asset
maintenance compliance to the appropriate regu-
lators. Examiners should determine whether the
daily record and the monthly report for asset
maintenance are appropriately maintained and
reported.

ASSET MAINTENANCE
CALCULATION

The first part of the asset maintenance calcula-
tion requires a determination of eligible assets.
To determine eligible assets, the examiner
deducts the ineligible assets from the gross asset
position of the branch. Ineligible assets fall
into two categories: those that are Ineligible
by Statute, and those that are Ineligible by
Examiner.

Assets Ineligible By Statute

Generally, assets that are Ineligible By Statute
might include the following:

• Any type of asset not specifically identified as
eligible by statute or regulation by the appro-
priate licensing agency;

• Any other asset that fails to meet specific
eligibility standards contained in the statute or
regulation by the appropriate licensing agency.

The specific assets that are Ineligible By
Statute will vary according to the requirements
