significantly, it does increase the likelihood that the leverage ratio may bind for some of 

these firms at some times—particularly for those firms with a broker-dealer-intensive 

business model in which the ratio of total assets to risk-weighted assets tends to be 

higher.  In this event, there would indeed be a significant tax on SFTs undertaken in the 

affected firms.  However, because it is unlikely that the leverage constraint would bind 

symmetrically across all of the largest firms, my guess is that the effect would be less to 

deter SFT activity in the aggregate than to cause it to migrate in such a way as to be 

predominantly located in those firms that—because they have, say, a larger lending 

business and, hence, more risk-weighted assets—have more headroom under the leverage 

ratio constraint.  

Other Possible Approaches 

 To summarize the discussion thus far, the mainstays of our existing regulatory 

toolkit—risk-based capital, liquidity, and leverage requirements—have a variety of other 

virtues, but none seem well-suited to lean in a comprehensive way against the specific 

fire-sale externalities created by SFTs.  The liquidity coverage ratio affects a subset of 

SFTs in which a dealer firm acts as a principal to fund its own inventory of securities 

positions, but does not meaningfully touch those in which it acts as an intermediary.  By 

contrast, an aggressively calibrated leverage ratio could potentially impose a significant 

tax on a wider range of SFTs, but the tax would by its nature be blunt and highly 

asymmetric, falling entirely on those firms for whom the leverage ratio constraint was 

more binding than the risk-based capital constraint.  As such, it would be more likely to 

induce regulatory arbitrage than to rein in overall SFT activity.
