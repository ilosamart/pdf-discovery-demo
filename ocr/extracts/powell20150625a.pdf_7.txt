increasingly prefer to rely on cards and mobile phones.  Payment cards have improved 

convenience and security in certain ways, like reducing the impact of a stolen wallet. 

But history has also shown that new technologies must be adopted in a prudent 

fashion.  Technological innovations can provide substantial benefits to payment system 

efficiency and security in the long run, but they often introduce new, unanticipated risks. 

For example, although payments cards reduced the impact of a stolen wallet, theyâ€™ve also 

introduced new risks, like counterfeit card fraud.  It is important that we identify and 

address the unanticipated risks that inevitably result when we try new things.  These risks 

may be tolerable in the short run, so long as we work to identify, prevent, and mitigate 

them early on in the design and implementation process.  In the case of payment cards, 

over time, technologies have been broadly implemented to mitigate many of the risks.  

For instance, computer algorithms now analyze transactions in real time and can prevent 

the same card number from being used to make purchases in Washington, D.C. and in 

Kansas City five minutes apart.  

We also need to consider the complexity of the payment system.  It is a vast 

network with millions of endpoints and a wide variety of participants.  Many innovators 

do a good job of incorporating advanced security features into their individual products. 

But new products also need to be securely integrated into the payment system as a whole. 

To innovate safely, payment system participants must work together by 

participating in coordinated efforts to improve the payment system.  At a minimum, 

banks, merchants, and other institutions that process or store sensitive financial 

information need to keep their hardware and software current to the latest industry 

standards.  Network operators and standards-setting bodies play an important role by
