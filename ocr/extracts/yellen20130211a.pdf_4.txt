between the actual and the predicted path of real output gives a sense of how much 

economic performance has lagged in this recovery.  But the implications of this result 

may seem a little abstract, so let me illustrate the same idea in a way that tries to show the 

burden that workers continue to bear in this slow recovery.    

Exhibit 2 shows how employment has declined and recovered following several 

previous recessions.  The employment measure attempts to control for the fact that 

demographic changes and other factors have altered the trend, or potential, workforce 

over the years.  For example, in the 1970s, the pool of potential workers was expanding 

as baby boomers and an increasing share of women moved into the labor force, such that 

employment needed to rise relatively quickly just to absorb these additional workers.  

More recently, the aging of the population has put downward pressure on labor force 

participation, so employment hasn’t had to grow as quickly to keep pace with the 

potential workforce.  

Even after making this adjustment, however, the Great Recession stands out both 

for the magnitude of the job losses that attended the downturn and for the weak recovery 

in employment that occurred after the recession ended.   

In trying to account for why this recovery has been so weak, it is helpful to first 

consider several important factors that have in the past supported most economic 

recoveries.  By this I don’t mean everything that contributes to economic growth, but 

rather those things that typically play a key role when the U.S. economy is recovering 

from recession.  Think of these as the tailwinds that usually promote a recovery.
