Thank you.  It is truly a pleasure for me to join President Bullard and Chairman 

Cotney in welcoming you to the Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, 

which I am proud to say has been cosponsored since its inception by the Federal Reserve 

System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS).   

This is the third year for this conference, which I consider a milestone.  The first 

time you organize a conference like this, all you can be sure about is that there was 

indeed enough research and interest for such a conference.  The second time it is held, 

you proved that you could do it again.   

But the third year, this year, is when we can start to feel we have established a 

tradition.  If this yearâ€™s conference comes even close to being as successful as the first 

two were, and I expect it will be, I hope that we have established an ongoing role for this 

gathering, which provides such a great opportunity for bankers, regulators, and academic 

researchers to come together to share ideas and insights about the issues that matter most 

in community banking.   

 Based on the agenda and conference materials I have seen, I expect participants 

over the next two days will tackle some of the most important issues facing community 

banks, provoke discussion and debate about opportunities and challenges, and generate 

some promising ideas about how community banks can continue to play the 

indispensable role they have played in so many communities.  The lineup of speakers, 

which includes my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor Brainard, is impressive.  

She and others will delve deeply into the important research questions and other issues 

facing community banking.
