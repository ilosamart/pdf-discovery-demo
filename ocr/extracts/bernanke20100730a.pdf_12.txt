take into account that accrued pension benefits of state and local workers in many 

jurisdictions are accorded strong legal protection, including, in some states, constitutional 

protection.11

In addition to pensions, states will have to address the burgeoning cost of retiree 

health benefits.  Estimates of these liabilities are subject to significant uncertainty, largely 

because we have little basis on which to project health-care costs decades into the future.  

However, one recent estimate suggests that state governments have a collective liability 

of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.

Of course, the demographic and health-care trends faced by state governments 

present severe challenges for federal fiscal policymakers as well.  Long-term projections 

of the federal government’s budget under current policies and plausible economic 

assumptions show a structural budget gap that is both large relative to the size of the 

economy and increasing over time.

  These benefits have traditionally been 

funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and therefore could entail a substantial fiscal burden in 

coming years as large numbers of state workers retire.

American Economic Review, vol. 99 (May), 538-42.  It should be noted that future pension accruals and 
health benefits generally seem to be accorded a lower level of protection. 

  To steer clear of sudden, sharp, and disruptive 

shifts in spending programs and tax policies, and to retain the confidence of the public 

and financial markets, federal policymakers need to develop a credible plan to restore 

fiscal sustainability.
