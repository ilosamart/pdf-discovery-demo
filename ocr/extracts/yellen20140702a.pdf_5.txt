vulnerabilities might have been affected had the Federal Reserve tightened monetary 

policy in the mid-2000s to promote financial stability.   

Looking Back at the Mid-2000s

sector and the macroeconomy.  Policymakers failed to anticipate that the reversal of the 

house price bubble would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the United States

the financial system and in government regulation.   

In the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage, 

excessive dependence on unstable short-term funding, weak underwriting of loans, 

deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management, and the use of exotic financial 

instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways.   

In the public sector, vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that 

allowed some systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and markets to escape

powers, and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a whole. 

It is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented 

or significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary policy in the mid-2000s.  At
