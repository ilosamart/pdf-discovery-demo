past few years.   

Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE), is estimated to have been a little bit below 2 percent of 

late, largely because of recent declines in energy prices.  However, core PCE inflation, 

which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future 

inflation, is estimated to have been about 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation 

compensation have moved lower, on net, since last summer, though they have increased 

some recently, and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are 

little changed.  That said, taken together, the evidence suggests that measures of expected 

inflation are at the lower end of a range that I consider to be consistent with our price-

stability goal of 2 percent PCE inflation.  

While my baseline outlook for growth, employment, and inflation is a positive 

one, a number of crosscurrents that are buffeting the economy bear careful scrutiny.  

Global growth is slowing, particularly in China and Europe.  Global policy uncertainty 

remains elevated.  And financial conditions have been volatile, making efforts to extract 

signal from noise more challenging.  

Monetary Policy 

As I have indicated in recent speeches, monetary policy at this juncture needs to 

be especially data dependent, with the federal funds rate now in the range of Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) participantsâ€™ estimates of its longer-run neutral level.  

Moreover, with employment and inflation now at or close to our dual-mandate objectives, 

the FOMC in its January statement indicated it can afford to be patient as we assess the
