Unsolicited Written Offers of Credit and Insurance 43 

To complete a fraudulent application, a potential thief would also need not only name and 
address but also certain unique identifiers such as mother’s maiden name, Social Security 
number, and other information such as mortgage payments. According to Chase, the 
need for personal information is the reason that 40 percent of the small proportion of such 
cases arises from persons familiar to the victim, often family members or those in 
positions of trust. For the company, identity theft involving prescreened accounts 
amounted to 600 out of 75,000 fraud cases in 2002 (less than 1 percent) and out of 17 
million active card accounts (less than 0.004 percent). The 600 cases in 2002 were less 
than 0.04 percent of the 1.6 million new accounts opened by Chase that year through 
prescreened solicitations.40 

Although such evidence shows that fraud of this sort exists, it also suggests that the 
incidence is relatively small because there are means to contain it, and much of the 
remainder arises from family members or associates, who are difficult to control. It does 
not seem that the existence of prescreened solicitations is likely to make the identity theft 
situation noticeably worse. It would be easy enough for someone familiar with the 
victim’s identity information, such as a disgruntled family member or dedicated thief, to 
apply for credit using a false identity through normal “take one” brochures or Internet 
channels without waiting for a prescreened mailing, which does not contain much 
identifying information anyway. As the testimony of Chase pointed out, most identity 
thieves are not going to take the approach of submitting an application subject to 
verification of information that is generally not easily available to thieves who are not 
family members. 

Also, the Fact Act contains two provisions dealing with prescreened solicitations that are 
designed, at least in part, to address identify theft issues. First, if a consumer places an 
extended fraud alert in his or her file at a CRA, the CRA must exclude the consumer from 
prescreened lists for five years, unless the consumer requests otherwise. Second, if a 
consumer places an active-duty military alert in his or her file at a CRA, the CRA must 
exclude that consumer from prescreened lists for two years, unless the consumer requests 
otherwise. 

PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS 

Third among potential consumer costs associated with prescreening are the privacy 
implications of prescreened solicitations. Some consumers may be concerned that 
creditors or insurers may have access to the consumer’s financial information held by 
CRAs before the consumer has indicated an interest in a creditor’s or insurer’s products. 
Consumers also may be concerned that once creditors or insurers obtain this financial 
information, these creditors or insurers may use the information for inappropriate 
purposes or share the information with other parties. As with inconvenience, however,
