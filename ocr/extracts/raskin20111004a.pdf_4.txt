And many borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure:  More than 4 percent of all 

mortgages in the United States were in foreclosure, and an additional 3 percent or so were 

delinquent by 90 days or more in the second quarter of this year.  Initially, when I was 

commissioner of financial regulation, foreclosures were concentrated among borrowers 

with subprime mortgages.  But today, because of the magnitude of the economic 

downturn and the high level of unemployment, the typical borrower in foreclosure has a 

prime or Federal Housing Administration mortgage. 

As all of you know, the drop in house prices has put considerable pressure on the 

legal system.  Of course, the huge wave of foreclosures has strained and sometimes 

overwhelmed the courts, particularly in states with judicial foreclosure processes.  But in 

a deeper sense, the standard contracts that govern mortgage lending, servicing, and 

securitization did not account for a potential collapse of this magnitude in the housing 

sector.  As the bubble expanded, securitization contracts did not provide enough incentive 

to discourage shoddy underwriting practices.  In the aftermath, the inadequacies of 

servicing contracts have contributed to the agonizingly slow pace of mortgage 

modifications and repeated breakdowns in the foreclosure process. 

Prior to the crisis, the nation’s mortgage finance system developed into an 

extensive set of specialized industry players with a complex set of linkages operating not 

just at the lender and borrower level, but also with an extensive secondary market that 

was intended to diffuse risk.  All of these relationships were governed by contracts.  The
