of one dollar per share, even as the actual value of the underlying assets varies within a modest 

range, is itself the consequence of the SEC’s Rule 2a-7, which exempts money market mutual 

funds from the requirement of a floating NAV generally applicable to open-end mutual funds.  In 

amending its rules in 2010, the SEC took some good first steps to improve the resilience of 

money market funds, but many – including Chairman Schapiro – do not believe these are 

sufficient to mitigate the run potential in money market funds.   

Unfortunately, a majority of the current SEC commissioners has to this point been 

opposed to moving forward with the reform measures Chairman Schapiro has proposed.  The 

FSOC, meanwhile, has endorsed further reform along these general lines.  The question, then, is 

how the FSOC and its other member agencies should proceed given that the SEC has declined to 

act.  I should note here that, during the debates preceding Dodd-Frank, some versions of 

proposals for what eventually became the FSOC would have empowered the FSOC to override 

agency action or inaction within its sphere of authority.  Others, including many who favored 

strong reforms, opposed this power, which would have created a kind of super-agency with veto 

authority over all the regulators.  Instead, the FSOC has the more limited authority to present an 

agency with recommendations for action and the right to receive an explanation should the 

agency not accept those recommendations. 

As you may have seen, two weeks ago Treasury Secretary Geithner sent a letter to the 

members of the FSOC in his capacity as its chair, in which he urged the Council to use its 

authority under Section 120 of Dodd-Frank, and to consider alternative actions  to reduce the 

structural vulnerabilities associate with money market funds  “in the event the SEC is unwilling 

to act in a timely manner.”43  These alternatives could include FSOC designation of money 

market funds as systemically important and thus subject to the prudential requirements
