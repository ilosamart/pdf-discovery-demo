Compliance
Introduction
Effective Date July 1997 Section 5000.1

Head office management should develop adequate
policies and procedures to ensure that the branch
is in compliance with all applicable U.S. federal
and state laws and regulations, including report-
ing and special supervisory requirements.

To the extent possible given the size, risk
profile and organizational structure of the branch,
these responsibilities should be vested in a
branch official or compliance officer whose
function is separate from line management. The
compliance officer should be qualified and
familiar with U.S. and state laws and regulations.

Branch management and the compliance offi-
cer should ensure that all appropriate personnel

are properly trained in meeting regulatory
requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition,
the training program should ensure that branch
personnel are informed of U.S. and state laws
and regulations to which the branch may be
subject.

The scope of the branch’s audit function also
should ensure that the branch is meeting all
applicable regulatory requirements. The head
office should ensure that the audit team is
qualified to audit its U.S. branch operations for
compliance with U.S. and state laws, regula-
tions, and regulatory reporting requirements.

Asset Maintenance
Effective date July 1997 Section 5020.1

Asset maintenance was originally developed as
a method of ensuring that, in the event of a
liquidation, sufficient assets would be available
to effect repayment to depositors and liability
holders. Although asset maintenance is not a
capital equivalent, branches under asset mainte-
nance have some of the characteristics of a
separately capitalized entity. In fact, in the early
stages of asset maintenance, ratios of 108 per-
cent and 105 percent were established to be
roughly equivalent to the then-prevailing capital
ratios of U.S. domestic banks.

Generally, asset maintenance is defined as the
maintenance of eligible assets in a branch in a
particular state, covering a specified percent-
age of a branch’s third party liabilities. The
asset maintenance calculation is determined by
dividing eligible assets by liabilities requiring
cover.

Asset maintenance is generally defined and
enforced by the licensing agency. Examiners
should consult the appropriate regulation of the
appropriate agency to define and calculate the
ratio. Asset maintenance may also be imposed
by regulators through the issuance of supervi-
sory action. The supervisory imposition of asset
maintenance has significant effects on the branch
depending upon the percentage imposed. When
imposed at levels above 100 percent, a branch
must maintain a net due to related parties
position at all times. This effectively prevents
the branch from providing net funding to the
head office or other related offices. Asset main-
tenance levels below 100 percent would have
the effect of limiting the net due from related
parties position.

Asset maintenance requirements will differ by
state. Some states do not require coverage for all
third party liabilities booked at the branch (e.g.
IBF deposits). Therefore, even though a branch
meets the state’s asset maintenance require-
ments, the branch may still be in a net due from
affiliates position. In the event of a financially
weak FBO, regulators may consider expanding
the asset maintenance requirements to further
define eligible assets and liabilities to ensure
adequate coverage of all third party deposits.

State licensing authorities may impose asset
maintenance as a requirement of licensure within
that state. The FDIC imposes asset maintenance
as a requirement for receiving deposit insurance.

Asset maintenance may also be imposed at
individual branches or FBO offices as a form of

supervisory action for the U.S. operations of a
foreign banking organization. This action may
relate to supervisory concerns raised in deter-
mining the financial strength of the FBO, includ-
ing circumstances in the home country that
could adversely affect the FBO’s U.S. opera-
tions. Asset maintenance, in these instances,
may be necessary, even though the U.S. opera-
tions are in satisfactory condition.

As a result of statute, regulation, or supervi-
sory agreement, special requirements and guide-
lines for determining the amount of eligible
assets and calculating the asset maintenance
percentage may be required by the appropriate
regulatory agency. These requirements will
necessitate the maintenance of specific records
at the branch. A branch under asset maintenance
will also be required to periodically report asset
maintenance compliance to the appropriate regu-
lators. Examiners should determine whether the
daily record and the monthly report for asset
maintenance are appropriately maintained and
reported.

ASSET MAINTENANCE
CALCULATION

The first part of the asset maintenance calcula-
tion requires a determination of eligible assets.
To determine eligible assets, the examiner
deducts the ineligible assets from the gross asset
position of the branch. Ineligible assets fall
into two categories: those that are Ineligible
by Statute, and those that are Ineligible by
Examiner.

Assets Ineligible By Statute

Generally, assets that are Ineligible By Statute
might include the following:

• Any type of asset not specifically identified as
eligible by statute or regulation by the appro-
priate licensing agency;

• Any other asset that fails to meet specific
eligibility standards contained in the statute or
regulation by the appropriate licensing agency.

The specific assets that are Ineligible By
Statute will vary according to the requirements

Branch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997
Page 1


contained in federal and state laws and regula-
tions. The following is representative of some of
the requirements that may be imposed. Any
asset for which:

• Evidence of indebtedness (original signed note
or loan agreement) is not held in the United
States or the state within which the branch is
licensed;

• Evidence of indebtedness is in transit within
the FBO system, either outside the United
States or outside the state in which the branch
is licensed;

• Repayment is to be made in funds not freely
convertible to U.S. dollars;

• Reclassification to an expense category is
pending.

In addition requirements may be imposed on:

• Types of securities and depreciation;
• The documentation and collection of loans;
• The type, location, holding, and depreciation

of fixed assets;
• All amounts due from the head office and

other depository and nondepository offices
and affiliates, including income accrued but
uncollected on such amounts.

The balance of any asset disallowed at the
preceding examination will be treated as ineli-
gible until the underlying reasons for the disal-
lowance have been removed.

Assets Ineligible By Examiner

If an examiner, during the course of an exami-
nation, determines that the value of any nonmar-
ketable bond, note, debenture, or any other asset
would preclude complete repayment, the exam-
iner may consider that asset ineligible for asset
maintenance purposes. The portion considered
unrecoverable is disallowed.

Disallowances of classified assets will differ
based on the criteria or guidelines used by the
various regulatory agencies. The following for-
mula is representative of some of the disallow-
ances that may be used: Loss—100 percent of
book value; Doubtful—50 percent of book value;
Substandard—20 percent of book value, and
Value Impaired—100 percent of the amount
equivalent to the Allocated Transfer Risk
Reserve, plus 20 percent of any residual expo-

sure. In addition, all accrued interest on assets
subject to a Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, or
Value Impaired classification is usually
disallowed.

An examiner may also disallow any loan or
other credit exposure that is not supported by
sufficient credit information (in English) to per-
mit an evaluation of the creditworthiness or
other risks inherent in the asset. Examiners are
to exercise prudence in disallowing assets for
this reason.

Situations may arise where an asset can be
disallowed for both statutory and discretionary
reasons. For example, a loan may be disallowed
by statute because the evidence of indebtedness
is not held in the state where the branch is
located. Additionally, the loan may be classified
Substandard, Doubtful, Loss, or Value Impaired.
In this case, the branch (for periodic reporting to
the regulators) and/or the examiner can disallow
the asset by statute and classify the loan. Of
course, no further disallowance is made on the
basis of the asset classification.

Where an asset is controlled jointly by the
branch and a related party, it is necessary to
determine whether the branch has independent
control ( i.e. the ability to withdraw the asset
without a cosignatory). If so, the item should not
be disallowed simply because another office
retains signing authority.

By definition, a certificate-less security (those
represented by advises or confirmations) cannot
be in the owner’s possession. Nevertheless, this
type of security may be an eligible asset, even if
the depository is located outside the state where
the branch is located, provided that both of the
following conditions are met: (1) The security is
held by the depository in the name of the branch
or in the name of an unrelated broker, agent, or
custodian (the exchange member) who is located
in the state where the branch is licensed; and
(2) The asset is properly shown on the branch’s
records so as to permit the appropriate regula-
tors to freeze the account immediately upon
taking possession of the branch.

Reserves maintained at the local Federal
Reserve Bank, pursuant to Regulation D, and
assets pledged to the FDIC, in connection with
deposit insurance regulations, are eligible assets.
Securities held by the Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral against possible borrowing are eligible
on the same basis as if held by the branch. The
amount of any borrowing must be deducted
from the value determined.

Liabilities Requiring Coverage

Once eligible assets are determined, the asset
maintenance computation requires a determina-
tion of liabilities requiring cover. Generally,
liabilities requiring cover include all liabilities
of a branch and may even include certain
contingent liabilities, as determined by the
appropriate regulators. The liabilities will be
adjusted to exclude the following:

• Amounts due and other liabilities to other
offices, agencies, branches, and affiliates of
the FBO, including unremitted profits;

• Reserves for loan losses and other
contingencies;

• Any other liability, as specifically required by
statute, regulation, or the appropriate regulators.

cies, practices, procedures, or internal con-
trols are deficient or when violations of laws
or regulations have been noted.

Asset Maintenance
Examination Procedures
Effective date July 1997 Section 5020.3

The following procedures will determine if the
branch under examination has established satis-
factory periodic reporting, operating standards,
and audit procedures regarding asset mainte-
nance. Examiner discretion is required in apply-
ing these procedures.

1. Review applicable statutes, regulations,
and/or supervisory requirements for asset
maintenance.

2. Test compliance with policies, practices,
procedures, and internal controls for appro-
priate asset maintenance monitoring.

3. Obtain the most recent asset maintenance
report filed with the regulators and deter-
mine its accuracy. If necessary, review pre-
vious submissions to determine any trends
in reporting errors.

4. Verify that eligible assets, as included in the
filed reports, are correct. Ensure that, in
addition to credits, categories such as due
from related parties, securities, fixed assets,
and other assets have been appropriately
adjusted.

5. Test check the asset maintenance computa-
tion for accuracy with statutory and super-
visory requirements. Ensure that liabilities
requiring cover have been appropriately
adjusted.

6. Review assets considered ineligible by the
branch for appropriateness and compliance
with laws, regulations, and supervisory
requirements.

7. Determine that assets purchased by the
branch are properly reflected at fair market
value. While fair market value may be
difficult to determine, it should, at a mini-
mum, reflect both the rate of return being
earned on such assets and an appropriate
risk premium. Determine that appropriate
write-offs are taken on any assets sold by
the branch at less than book value.

8. Review credits acquired from another lend-
ing institution as a result of a purchase,
participation, or asset swap since the previ-
ous examination, to determine that the

branch has appropriate agreements evidenc-
ing the acquisition and credit documentation.

9. Review credit classifications for appropriate
inclusion in asset maintenance reports.

10. Review credits that have been classified
and/or are considered as problems by man-
agement. If credits have been internally
classified, test whether they and their asso-
ciated accrued interest receivable have been
appropriately removed from eligible assets.

11. Determine whether any of the loans trans-
ferred were nonperforming at the time of
transfer, classified at the previous examina-
tion, or, for any other reason, were consid-
ered to be of questionable quality.

12. Scan the delinquency lists submitted to the
head office to determine that reports are
sufficiently detailed to evaluate risk factors
that could possibly identify credits that
might be considered Ineligible By Examiner.

13. Compile a listing of all loans not supported
by current and satisfactory credit informa-
tion, collateral documentation, and evi-
dences of indebtedness.

14. Ascertain whether loans are purchased on a
recourse basis and are sold on a nonrecourse
basis.

15. Verify that asset maintenance monitoring
and reports filed with appropriate regulators
are reviewed for compliance by branch
management and that internal controls are
adequate.

16. Organize and prepare a listing of violations
of asset maintenance laws, regulations, and
supervisory requirements.

17. Prepare the following examination report
pages:
• Ineligible Assets
• Asset Maintenance and Pledge Schedule

18. Prepare comments for the Compliance and
Violation of Laws and Regulations pages, if
necessary.

19. Prepare a complete set of workpapers to
support conclusions and examination report
pages and discuss all material findings with
management.

Asset Pledge and Capital Equivalency Deposits
Effective date July 1997 Section 5030.1

Asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit
accounts may be established as a requirement
for licensing a branch. These accounts are
designed to provide a ready source of liquid
assets to begin to pay for the expenses of a
liquidation, in the event it became necessary to
take possession of a branch.

Federal and state licensing authorities may
prescribe, by statute or regulation, requirements
and conditions under which the branch will
establish, maintain, and conduct an asset pledge
or capital equivalency deposit account. These
conditions and requirements will vary from one
regulatory agency to another. However, the fol-
lowing represents some of the conditions or
requirements that may be imposed:

• Balance in the account may be a specific
dollar amount and/or a variable amount based
on a specified percentage of third party liabili-
ties (i.e., related party liabilities and other
specific liabilities are usually excluded);

• Guidelines for establishing the account (i.e.,
account must be held by a third party, in the
name of the licensing authority);

• Types of assets available for pledging or
deposit (i.e., certificates of deposit, U.S. gov-
ernment securities, etc.);

• Conducting transactions (i.e., regulatory
approval for deposits and withdrawals and
direct confirmation to the licensing authority
may be required).

Asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit
accounts, in severe problem situations, can also
be used as a form of supervisory follow-up
action. When severe problem situations are
encountered, the licensing authority may require
an upward adjustment by the branch in the
balance of the applicable account. This may be
done by increasing the, normally required, spe-
cific dollar amount and/or the variable amount,
based on a specified percentage of third party
liabilities. The amount of the increase should be
sufficient to give the regulators additional funds
to cover expenses associated with a branch
liquidation.

International Banking Facilities
Effective date July 1997 Section 5050.1

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System amended Regulations D and Q effective
December 3, 1981, to permit U.S. depository
institutions, Edge and Agreement Corporations
and U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs to
establish International Banking Facilities (IBFs)
in the United States.

The Board’s objective was to enhance the
international competitive position of banking
institutions in the United States by permitting,
through an institution’s IBF, similar deposit
reserve and tax treatment afforded to offshore
banking offices. As a result, an IBF was permit-
ted to maintain a lower rate of reserves on IBF
liabilities maintained in excess of IBF assets.
When adjustments to the deposit reserve require-
ments were made in September 1990, an IBF’s
relative advantage with respect to deposit
reserves was effectively eliminated. However, in
some states, there still remain tax advantages to
maintaining IBFs. Furthermore, many FBOs
continue to use their IBFs as funding vehicles on
the assumption that former reserve requirements
may be reestablished.

Examinations of IBFs are ordinarily con-
ducted in conjunction with examinations of the
branches operating those facilities, and follow
the same supervisory procedures.

While a branch is not required to establish a
separate organization for IBF operations, it is
required to segregate on its books, the asset and
liability accounts included in the IBF.

In general, IBFs may accept deposits from
and extend credit to non-U.S. residents or other
IBFs. The Board’s rules impose various restric-
tions and limitations on the type of business in
which an IBF can engage. These restrictions
were designed to avoid complicating the con-
duct of domestic monetary policy and insulate
U.S. economic activity from IBF transactions.
As outlined in Regulation D, Section 204.8,
these restrictions include:

• Prohibiting the lending to or accepting of
deposits from a U.S. resident, other than the
branch establishing the IBF or other IBFs;

• Prohibiting the acceptance of transaction
accounts;

• Prohibiting the issuance of negotiable or bearer
instruments;

• Requiring nonbank deposits to carry a mini-
mum maturity or required notice period of two
business days; bank deposits can be made
with overnight maturities;

• Subjecting nonbank customer transactions to a
minimum deposit or withdrawal amount of
$100,000, except to close out an account or
withdraw accumulated interest;

• Requiring the IBF to notify its nonbank cus-
tomers, in writing, at the time an account
relationship is first established that the depos-
its received by the IBF may be used only to
support its non-U.S. operations, and exten-
sions of credit by the IBF may be used only to
finance the customers’ non-U.S. operations. In
the case of customers that are foreign affiliates
of U.S. residents, the IBF is required to obtain
acknowledgment of the receipt of such notice.

Branches may book off-balance-sheet items
in the IBF, provided the customer and the
transactions comply with applicable regulations.
Generally, off-balance-sheet items are booked at
an IBF to take advantage of favorable tax rates
or to hedge IBF assets and liabilities. Examiners
should review the reasons for booking such
items in the IBF and determine the appropriate-
ness of such action.

In addition, certain states impose further
restrictions and requirements governing the
establishment and maintenance of IBFs. The
examiner should review these restrictions and
requirements prior to establishing the scope of
the review.

Examination Procedures
Effective date July 1997 Section 5050.3

1. Complete or update the Internal Control
Questionnaire if selected for implementation.

2. Review applicable statutes, regulations,
and/or supervisory requirements for asset
maintenance.

3. Review IBF ledgers to determine that IBF
accounts are clearly segregated from the
establishing entity’s books. (Note: IBF led-
gers may be integrated with the establishing
entity’s general ledger or may be main-
tained as a separate general ledger. If the
ledgers are included with the establishing
entity’s regular accounts, the IBF accounts
must be clearly labeled. IBF assets need not
balance with IBF liabilities.)

4. Determine the adequacy of the internal
audit procedures used to check compliance
with applicable regulations. Obtain a list of
any deficiencies noted in the latest review
performed by the internal auditors and deter-
mine if corrections have been made.

5. In addition to verifying application of the
branch’s standard review, analysis, and/or
documentation of IBF-booked credits and
deposits, evaluate the adequacy of proce-
dures by reviewing a sample of accounts to
ensure that:
a. All deposits, extensions of credit, and

off-balance-sheet items are extended to
or accepted from qualified customers,
i.e., foreign residents, other IBFs, and
offices of the branch establishing the
IBF.

b. Nonbank extensions of credit are used
only to finance the non-U.S. operations
of the customer.

c. Nonbank deposits are used only to sup-
port the non-U.S. operations of the
customer.

d. Nonbank customers are provided written
notice of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors’ policy statement at the time
the deposit or credit relationship is first
established advising of the requirement
regarding the non-U.S. use of deposits
and credit extensions.

e. In the case of loans to or deposits from
foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations,

verify that written confirmation is
obtained acknowledging receipt of the
Board of Governors’ policy. (Note: IBF
transactions with foreign governments
and official institutions are treated in the
same manner as IBF transactions with
foreign banks, i.e. written notice of the
non-U.S. use of funds is not necessary.)

f. Nonbank deposits meet the minimum
maturity or required notice period for
withdrawal of two business days.

g. Nonbank time deposits and withdrawals
(except for account closings and with-
drawals of accumulated interest) meet
the minimum size transaction amount of
$100,000.

h. Deposit confirmations state that funds
are being placed in an IBF and that the
depositor must abide by IBF restrictions
as defined by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.

6. Review all intrabank transactions for an
appropriate time period to determine that:
a. All transactions with the U.S. offices of

the IBF’s own branch are clearly
identifiable.

b. Eurocurrency liabilities are properly
reported by the IBF’s establishing branch.

7. Review IBF purchases from and sales to
third parties to determine that:
a. Such assets are IBF eligible assets, and

appropriate notices and acknowledg-
ments have been provided and uses of
proceeds documented.

b. The transactions are at arms length, with-
out recourse.

c. The transactions are not conducted with
affiliates, other than the branch establish-
ing the IBF.

8. Review all IBF-related regulatory reports,
e.g., the FFIEC-002 and FR 2951, if appli-
cable, to determine their timely submission
and accuracy.

9. Discuss apparent violations and procedural
deficiencies with appropriate officer(s).

10. Prepare comments in appropriate report form
for all violations and deficiencies noted.

Review of Regulatory Reports
Effective date July 1997 Section 5060.1

The regulatory agencies rely on the timely and
accurate filing of regulatory reports by domestic
and foreign financial institutions. Data collected
from regulatory reports facilitate early identifi-
cation of problem situations. The Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) amended various banking statutes to
enhance the Federal Reserve’s authority to assess
civil money penalties against state member
banks, bank holding companies and FBOs that
file late, false, or misleading regulatory reports.
The civil money penalties also can be assessed
against individuals who cause or participate in
such filings including those who sign officially
submitted reports.

FILING

The Federal Reserve has identified a late regu-
latory report as an official copy of a report that
is not received by the Reserve Bank or its
designated electronic collection agent in a timely
manner. The filing of a completed original
report is timely in the following cases:

• The report is received by the Reserve Bank at
the end of the reporting day on the submission
deadline, including reports filed electronically;

• The report is mailed first class and is post-
marked no later than the third calendar day
preceding the submission deadline, no matter
when the report is received by the district
Federal Reserve Bank. In the absence of a
postmark, an institution may be called upon to
provide proof of timely mailing, if the report
has been received after the submission dead-
line; or

• The completed original report is delivered to
an overnight package delivery service on the
day before the submission deadline. An insti-
tution may be called upon to provide proof of
timely delivery to the service, if the report has
been received after the submission deadline.

The filing of a false report generally involves
the submission of mathematically incorrect data,
such as addition errors or transpositions, the
submission of call reports without appropriate
schedules, or the inadvertent filing of inaccurate
information. Conversely, the filing of a mislead-

ing report involves some degree of knowing or
reckless behavior on the part of the filer and the
intentional or negligent submission of inaccu-
rate information to the Federal Reserve.

FEDERAL RESERVE
REGULATORY REPORTS
MONITORING SYSTEM

The Federal Reserve System has a Regulatory
Reports Monitoring Program (program) to iden-
tify those banking institutions under its supervi-
sion that file late and false reports. Each Reserve
Bank maintains records of late and false report-
ers and submits summary reports of these records
to Board staff after every reporting period.

To promote consistent treatment under the
program, the Reserve Banks may not grant grace
periods or extensions of the submission dates of
regulatory reports. In addition, the program
requires Board staff responsible for enforcement
actions to consult with Reserve Bank staff to
ensure that appropriate follow-up supervisory
actions are taken, and that the Federal Reserve
addresses all instances of chronic late and false
regulatory reporting through civil money penal-
ties or other enforcement proceedings.

REVIEW OF REGULATORY
REPORTS

Review of regulatory reports involves determin-
ing whether the management of the branch has
submitted all required reports to the Federal
Reserve in a timely and accurate manner. The
examiner assigned to a specific department in
the branch is responsible for reviewing those
reports relating to that department and verifying
that the reports are accurate, meet statutory and
regulatory requirements, and agree with the
branch’s financial records. The examiner-in-
charge is to consolidate the findings of the
examination team and submit a list of regulatory
reporting errors to the appropriate Reserve Bank
staff, who will determine the extent to which the
branch will be required to file amended reports.

Examiners should discuss with Reserve Bank
staff any regulatory report that is considered
misleading as such a report could lead to the
issuance of suspicious activities report(s) against

Branch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997

the involved branch and/or individual(s). In
addition, management should be reminded that
civil money penalties may be assessed or other
enforcement proceedings may be initiated against
regulatory report filers who are chronically late
or repeatedly file seriously inaccurate reports.

Branches should maintain efficient internal
systems and procedures to ensure that reporting
is made in accordance with the appropriate
regulatory requirements. They should develop
clear, concise, and orderly workpapers to sup-
port the compilation of data. Preparation of
proper workpapers not only provides a logical
tie between report data and the branch’s finan-
cial records but also facilitates accurate report-
ing and verification.

A branch’s internal control program for regu-
latory reports should ensure that all required
reports are submitted on time and are accurate.
The specific internal controls employed by a
branch to meet those objectives depend largely
on the volume of reports, the scope of a branch’s
operations, and the complexity of its accounting
system.

REQUIRED REGULATORY
REPORTS

This section describes the regulatory reports
required to be submitted by the branch to the
Federal Reserve. In addition to the list of reports
outlined below, the examiner should also review
the reports that monitor compliance with asset
maintenance requirements, which are applicable
under state law or are required for federally-
licensed or -insured branches. For additional
information on state requirements, refer to the
Summary of Key State Statutes in the appendix
of this manual.

Report of Assets and Liabilities of
U.S. Branches & Agencies of Foreign
Banks (FFIEC 002 and 002S)

All branches are required to file a report of
assets and liabilities (known as the call report),
as of the last day of each calendar quarter.
Details of the appropriate reporting guidelines,
along with the specific report form to be filed,
are found in the Instructions for Preparation
of the Report of Assets and Liabilities of

U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks
(FFIEC 002).

The branch should submit the completed call
reports to the appropriate supervisory agencies
no more than 30 calendar days after the report
date. The Federal Reserve acts as the collecting
and processing agent of the call report for the
federal supervisory authorities.

The examiner should carefully review the
report to ensure that all pertinent data has been
reported and is properly categorized in accor-
dance with the call report instructions. To review
a particular branch’s call report, the examiner
must first understand the branch’s accounting
methods and the information located in, and the
relationships between, the branch’s general led-
ger and subsidiary ledgers. Workpapers used in
the preparation of the report and supplementary
schedules will aid the examiner in understand-
ing the branch’s system.

Applicable laws and regulations require
branches to file certain reports relating to spe-
cific business activities. For example, branches
are required to file reports associated with lost
and stolen securities, transfer agent activities,
municipal securities dealer activities, govern-
ment securities broker and dealer activities,
criminal referrals, and BSA reporting. Specific
comments relating to these activities are dis-
cussed under in the Other Compliance Matters
section of this manual. The examiner-in-charge
should identify all applicable reporting require-
ments of the branch and coordinate the review
of those reports.

Other Compliance Matters
Effective date July 1997 Section 5070.1

FBOs are subject to various other federal and
state laws and regulations not discussed else-
where in this manual. Similar to domestic bank-
ing organizations, FBOs operating in the United
States are required to be knowledgeable of these
laws and regulations and to establish policies,
practices, procedures, and internal controls to
ensure compliance.

The following discussion is divided into two
sections: Safety and Soundness Rules and Regu-
lations and Consumer Compliance Regulations.
State-licensed branches should refer to their
state statutory codes for specific statutes that
may apply. Additionally, federally-insured
branches are subject to the wide variety of laws
and regulations applicable to all federally-
insured depository institutions.

On January 17, 1978, the three federal bank
supervisory agencies issued a joint policy state-
ment to address their concern regarding the
potential for improper payments by banks and
bank holding companies in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Federal
Election Campaign Act. While not widespread,
the federal bank supervisory agencies were con-
cerned that such practices could reflect adversely
on the banking system and constitute unsafe and
unsound banking practices, in addition to their
possible illegality.

The potential devices for making political
payments in violation of the law could include
compensatory bonuses to employees, designated
expense accounts, fees or salaries paid to offi-
cers, and preferential or zero interest rate loans.
In addition, political contributions could be
made by providing equipment and services with-
out charge to candidates for office.

SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS
RULES AND REGULATIONS

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act—
15 USC 78DD-1, 78DD-2

Beginning in 1973, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) became aware of conduct by
some companies involving the use of corporate
funds for illegal domestic political contribu-
tions. Subsequent SEC investigations, revealed
instances in which some of the largest U.S.
corporations had secretly engaged in the bribery
of foreign officials. In the course of these

investigations, it became apparent that, in many
instances, these activities were concealed from
the outside auditors and others by maintaining
off-the-book bank accounts or otherwise circum-
venting the system of internal accounting
controls.

As a result of these investigations, Congress
passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (Act). This Act consists of two separate
groups of rules: (a) those that prohibit the
offering or payment of bribes to certain foreign
officials, and (b) those requiring the mainte-
nance of complete accounting books and records
and an effective system of accounting controls.

Section 78DD-1 applies to any issuer of
securities registered on a U.S. national securities
exchange. Thus, if an FBO has issued securities
so registered, the prohibition on certain corrupt
practices applies to the FBO. Section 78DD-2,
however, applies to any domestic concern, which
is defined in subsection (h)(1)(B) to include any
corporation which has its principal place of
business in the United States. Generally, ques-
tions of specific applicability of provisions of
this Act to U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs
should be referred to appropriate legal counsel.

Antibribery Provisions

These provisions of the Act prohibit any U.S.
company or business entity (and its officers,
directors, agents, employees, and shareholders
acting on its behalf) from using the mails,
telephone, transportation, or any other instru-
mentality of interstate or foreign commerce
corruptly, in furtherance of an offer, payment,
promise to pay, authorization of the payment of
any money, or other thing of value to:

• An official of a foreign government or instru-
mentality of a foreign government;

• A foreign political party or official thereof or
a candidate for political office; or,

• Any other person the payor knows of or has
reason to know, who will pay or give the
money or value to those listed above,

where the purpose is to influence an act or
decision (including a decision not to act) of the
recipient in his official capacity or to induce the
recipient to use his or her influence to affect or
influence an act or decision of the government

Branch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997
Page 1


or instrumentality, in order to assist such com-
pany or entity in obtaining, retaining, or direct-
ing business for itself or another person.

These provisions do not apply to payments to
any employee whose duties are essentially min-
isterial or clerical.

Accounting Provisions

Although the obligation to maintain accurate
books and records and to have an adequate
system of internal accounting controls has been
acknowledged by responsible corporations for a
long time, this obligation was not previously
explicitly established into law until the passage
of the Act. Applying essentially to all compa-
nies whose securities are publicly traded in the
United States, the Act requires them to:

• Make and keep books, records, and accounts,
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the issuer; and

• Devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide rea-
sonable assurance that:
— Transactions are executed in accordance

with management’s general or specific
authorizations;

— Transactions are recorded as necessary
(1) to permit preparation of financial state-
ments in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles or any other
criteria applicable to such statements and
(2) to maintain accountability for assets;

— Access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization; and,

— The recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at rea-
sonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any difference.

Acting under its authority to issue regula-
tions, the SEC issued regulations, which became
effective on March 23, 1979, concerning falsi-
fications of records and the making of false,
misleading, or incomplete statements to audi-
tors. The first of these regulations says that no
person shall, directly or indirectly, falsify or
cause to be falsified, any book, record or account
subject to the provisions of the law described
above, that is, those used for making reports
under the SEC laws.

The second regulation prohibits a director or
officer of an issuer from making or causing to be
made a materially false or misleading statement,
and from omitting to state or cause another
person to omit a material fact necessary to make
a statement not misleading to an accountant,
external or internal, in connection with an audit
of the financial statements or preparation of
required reports. Conviction of a willful viola-
tion of these accounting provisions carries a
possible $10,000 fine or up to five years impris-
onment, or both.

Federal Elections Campaign Act—
2 USC 441B

The Federal Elections Campaign Act (FECA),
enacted in 1971, was designed to curb potential
abuses in the area of federal election financing.
In general, FECA regulates the making of cam-
paign contributions and expenditures in connec-
tion with primary and general elections to fed-
eral offices and specifically bans campaign
contributions by national banks. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency has, by regula-
tion (12 CFR 28.101(4)), made this provision
applicable to federal branches and agencies.1
FECA does not specifically address the making
of contributions and expenditures by banks or
other corporations to advocate positions on issues
that are the subjects of public referenda. As
originally enacted, FECA required disclosure of
contributions received or expenditures made;
however, amendments to the law in 1974 and
1976 imposed additional limitations on contri-
butions and expenditures as well. The 1974
amendments also established the Federal Elec-
tion Commission (Commission) to administer
FECA’s provisions. The Commission is respon-
sible for adopting rules to carry out FECA, for
rendering advisory opinions, and for enforcing
the Act. The Commission was reorganized as a
result of the FECA Amendments of 1976 and it
has since issued regulations interpreting the
statute Title 11 of the CFR.

1. 2 USC 441a, however, limits campaign contributions by
any person. The definition of person in 2 USC 431(h) is very
broad and could include the U.S. branches and agencies of
FBOs. Accordingly, any questions in this area should be
referred to appropriate legal counsel. In addition, 2 USC 441e
prohibits campaign contributions by foreign nationals (the
definition of which excludes U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent
resident aliens).

September 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual

Contributions and Expenditures

The words contribution and expenditure are
defined broadly by FECA and the Commission’s
regulations to include any loan, advance, deposit,
purchase, payment, distribution, subscription,
gift of money, or anything of value that is made
for the purpose of influencing the nomination or
election of any person to federal office. The
payment by a third party of compensation for
personal services rendered without charge to a
candidate or political committee is also treated
as a contribution by FECA, although the term
does not include the value of personal services
provided by an individual without compensation
on a volunteer basis.

Although loans are included in the definitions
of contribution and expenditure under FECA, a
specific exemption is provided for bank loans
made in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with applicable banking laws and
regulations. The Commission’s regulations pro-
vide further that extensions of credit to a candi-
date, political committee, or other person in
connection with a federal election may be treated
as a loan, and not a contribution, if they are on
terms substantially similar, in risk and amount,
to those made to nonpolitical debtors. The
regulations also provide that a debt may be
forgiven only if the creditor has treated it in a
commercially reasonable manner, including mak-
ing efforts to collect the debt, which are similar
to the efforts it would make with a nonpolitical
debtor. In considering whether a particular trans-
action is a contribution or a loan, it is expected
that a factor would be the extent to which the
creditor may have departed from its customary
credit risk analysis.

FECA and the implementing regulation per-
mit certain limited payments to candidates or
their political committees. For example, pay-
ment of compensation to a regular employee,
who is providing a candidate or political com-
mittee with legal or accounting services, which
are solely for the purpose of compliance with
the provisions of the FECA, is exempt from the
definitions of contribution and expenditure. The
Commission’s regulations also permit occa-
sional use of a corporation’s facilities by its
shareholders and employees for volunteer politi-
cal activity; however, reimbursement to the
corporation is required for the normal rental
charge for anything more than occasional or
incidental use.

Separate Segregated Funds and Political
Committees

FECA allows the establishment and administra-
tion by corporations of separate segregated funds
to be utilized for political purposes (2 USC
Section 441b(b)(4)). While corporate monies
may not be used to make political contributions
or expenditures, corporations may bear the costs
of establishing and administering these separate
segregated funds, including payment of rent for
office space, utilities, supplies, and salaries.
These costs need not be disclosed under FECA.
Commission regulations also permit a corpora-
tion to exercise control over its separate segre-
gated fund.

In practice, most corporate segregated funds
are administered by a group of corporate per-
sonnel, which, if the fund receives any contri-
butions or makes any expenditures during a
calendar year, constitutes a political committee,
as defined by FECA. As such, it is required to
file a statement of organization with the Com-
mission, to keep detailed records of contribu-
tions and expenditures, and to file with the
Commission reports identifying contributions in
excess of $200 and candidates who are recipi-
ents of contributions from the fund.

Solicitation of contributions to corporate seg-
regated funds by political committees must be
accomplished within the precise limits estab-
lished by FECA. All solicitations directed to
corporate employees must satisfy the following
requirements: (1) the contribution must be
entirely voluntary, (2) the employee must be
informed of the political purposes of the fund at
the time of the solicitation, and (3) the employee
must be informed of his or her right to refuse to
contribute without reprisal. Beyond those basic
requirements, FECA distinguishes between
executive and administrative personnel and other
employees. The former and their families may
be solicited any number of times, while the latter
and their families may only be solicited through
a maximum of two written solicitations per year,
and these solicitations must be addressed to the
employees at their homes. Solicitations may
also be directed to corporate stockholders and
their families in the same manner as to executive
and administrative personnel.

Although a corporation or a corporation and
its subsidiaries may form several political com-
mittees, for purposes of determining the statu-
tory limitations on contributions and expendi-
tures, all committees established by a corporation

Other Compliance Matters 5070.1

Branch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997
Page 3


and its subsidiaries are treated as one. Thus, the
total amount that all political committees of a
corporation and its subsidiaries may make to a
single candidate is $5,000 in any federal election
(provided that the committees are qualified multi-
candidate committees under FECA).

Violation of FECA by any corporation is
punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000,
and any director or officer of any corporation
who consents to any contribution or expenditure
by the corporation in violation of FECA is
subject to fine or imprisonment or both.

State laws concerning this matter should also
be reviewed by the examiner. However, FECA
preempts state law with respect to election to
federal office.

Bank Bribery Act—18 USC 215

The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984
amended the federal bank bribery law to pro-
hibit employees, officers, directors, agents, and
attorneys of financial institutions from seeking
or accepting anything of value in connection
with any transaction or business of their finan-
cial institution. The definition of a financial
institution in 18 USC 20(9) includes a U.S.
branch or agency of an FBO. The amended law
also prohibited anyone from offering or giving
anything of value to employees, officers, direc-
tors, agents, or attorneys of financial institutions
for or in connection with any transaction or
business of the financial institution. Because of
its broad scope, the 1984 Act raised concerns
that it might have made unlawful what had
previously been considered acceptable conduct.

In July 1985, the Department of Justice issued
a Policy Concerning Prosecution Under the New
Bank Bribery Statute. In that policy, the Justice
Department discussed the basic elements of the
prohibited conduct under Section 215, and indi-
cated that cases to be considered for prosecution
under the new bribery law entail breaches of
fiduciary duty or dishonest efforts to undermine
financial institution transactions. Because the
statute was intended to reach acts of corruption
in the banking industry, the Justice Department
expressed its intent not to prosecute insignificant
gift giving or entertaining that does not involve
a breach of fiduciary duty or dishonesty.

Congress decided that the broad scope of the
statute provided too much prosecutorial discre-
tion. Consequently, Congress adopted the Bank

Bribery Amendments Act of 1985 to narrow the
scope of 18 USC 215 by adding a new element,
namely, an intent to corruptly influence or reward
an officer in connection with financial institution
business.

This law now specifically excepts the pay-
ment of bona fide salary, wages, fees or other
compensation paid, or expenses paid or reim-
bursed in the usual course of business. In
addition, the law now requires the financial
institution regulatory agencies to publish guide-
lines to assist employees, officers, directors,
agents, and attorneys of financial institutions in
complying with the law. The branch’s internal
code or written policy should prohibit such
persons from (1) soliciting for themselves or for
a third party (other than the branch itself)
anything of value from anyone in return for any
business, service, or confidential information of
the branch and from (2) accepting anything of
value (other than bona fide salary, wages, and
fees) from anyone in connection with the busi-
ness of the branch, either before or after a
transaction is discussed or consummated. In
addition, the code/policy may specify appropri-
ate exceptions to the general prohibition of
accepting something of value in connection with
branch business.

Furthermore, the branch’s code of conduct or
written policy should provide that if a branch
official is offered or receives something of value
beyond what is permitted in the policy, that
branch official must disclose that incident to an
appropriately designated official of the financial
institution. The branch should maintain such
disclosures. A branch official’s full disclosure
evidences good faith when it is made in the
context of properly exercised supervision and
control. Management should review the disclo-
sures and determine that what is accepted is
reasonable and does not pose a threat to the
integrity of the branch. Thus, the prohibitions of
the bank bribery statute cannot be avoided by
simply reporting to management the acceptance
of various gifts.

The business luncheon or holiday season gift
from a customer generally is not a violation of
the statute if: (1) its acceptance is based on a
family or personal relationship existing indepen-
dent of any business of the financial institution,
(2) the benefit is available to the general public
under the same conditions on which it is avail-
able to the branch, or (3) the benefit would be
paid for by the branch as a reasonable business
expense if not paid for by another party. What is

5070.1 Other Compliance Matters

September 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual
Page 4


reasonable in one part of the country may appear
lavish in another part. Thus, the branch may
establish, in its own code/policy, a range of
dollar values, which cover the various benefits
that its officials may receive from those doing or
seeking to do business with the branch.

In addition to the exceptions discussed above,
the branch may describe other appropriate
exceptions to the general prohibition in its code
of conduct or written policy, such as those that:

• Permit acceptance of meals, refreshments,
travel arrangements, accommodations, or
entertainment, all of reasonable value and in
the course of a meeting or other occasion the
purpose of which is to hold bona fide business
discussions, provided that the expenses would
be paid for by the branch as a reasonable
business expense, if not paid for by another
party;

• Permit acceptance of loans from other branches
or financial institutions on customary terms to
finance proper and usual activities of branch
officials, such as home mortgage loans, except
where prohibited by law;

• Permit acceptance of advertising or promo-
tional material of reasonable value, such as
pens, pencils, note pads, key chains, calen-
dars, and similar items;

• Permit acceptance of discounts or rebates on
merchandise or services that do not exceed
those available to other customers;

• Permit acceptance of gifts of reasonable value
that are related to commonly recognized events
or occasions, such as a promotion, new job,
wedding, retirement, Christmas, or bar or bat
mitzvah;

• Permit the acceptance of civic, charitable,
educational, or religious organizational awards
for recognition of service and accomplishment.

A serious threat to the branch’s integrity
occurs when its officials become involved in
outside business interests or employment that
give rise to a conflict of interest. Such conflicts
of interest may evolve into corrupt transactions
that are covered under this Act. Accordingly, the
branch is encouraged to prohibit in its code/
policy, branch officials from self-dealing or
otherwise trading on their positions with the
branch or accepting a business opportunity from
someone doing or seeking to do business with
the branch, which is not available to other
persons or which is made available to the branch

official because of such person’s position with
the branch.

If the value of the item or benefit offered or
received exceeds $100, the offense is a felony
punishable by up to thirty years imprisonment
and a fine of up to $1,000,000 or three times the
value of the bribe or gratuity, whichever is
greater. If value does not exceed $100, the
offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to
one year imprisonment and a maximum fine of
$1,000.

Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The function of the Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury is to promulgate and administer regu-
lations dealing with the economic sanctions that
the U.S. government imposes against certain
foreign countries, against the nationals of those
countries, and against the specially designated
nationals of those countries. Under the Interna-
tional Emergency Economic Powers Act, the
President can impose sanctions such as trade
embargoes, freezing of assets, import sur-
charges, etc. These sanctions usually entail the
freezing of a country’s assets and are politically
motivated. Branches must block funds transfers
that (1) are remitted by or on behalf of a blocked
individual or entity; (2) are remitted to or
through a blocked entity; or (3)are remitted in
connection with a transaction in which a blocked
individual or entity has an interest. If a branch in
the U.S. receives instructions to make a payment
that falls into one of these categories, it is
required to execute the payment order and place
the funds into a blocked account. A payment
order cannot be canceled or amended after the
U.S. branch has received it. Once assets or funds
are blocked, they may be released only by
specific authorization from the U.S. Treasury.

A ‘‘specially designated national’’ is a person
or entity who acts on behalf of one of those
countries under economic sanction by the U.S.
The designation is done by the U.S. Secretary of
State. Dealing with such nationals is prohibited.
Moreover, their assets or accounts in the U.S. are
frozen. In certain cases, however, the Treasury
Department can issue a license to a designated
national. This license can then be presented by
the customer to the institution, allowing the
institution to debit his/her account. The license
can be either general or specific. The general

license is not a document but a provision in the
regulation itself authorizing certain transactions;
the branch must request the customer to sign an
affidavit stating that the particular transaction is
covered by a general license. The specific license
is a document (with U.S. Treasury seal, signa-
ture of OFAC’s Chief of Licensing and control
number) issued by OFAC on a case-by-case
basis to a specific individual or company allow-
ing an activity that otherwise is prohibited by
the regulations; the branch must request to see
the original license.

Blocking an account allows only credits to be
posted to a customer’s account. If OFAC imposes
the blocking of an account, then the account
cannot be used to settle claims, i.e., the branch is
prohibited from offsetting the account; no deb-
iting is allowed. Assets can also be blocked
whereby the Treasury Department exercises
powers and privileges associated with owner-
ship of all property and interests in property of
the sanctioned country’s government, its agen-
cies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities in
the United States or within the possession or
control of U.S. persons. An institution’s corre-
spondent banks accounts can also be blocked or
frozen. The branch is not allowed to tell its
customer if his/her account has been blocked by
OFAC.

A 602 Request is a national emergency inquiry
requested by the U.S. Secretary of State. The
U.S. government does not need an injunction
order for this request, and the recipient of such
a request must respond to the inquiry.

Any violation of the regulations implement-
ing the sanctions subjects the violator to crimi-
nal prosecution. Criminal penalties for violating
sanctions range up to 12 years in prison and
$1 million in corporate fines and $250,000 in
individual fines, per incident. In addition, civil
penalties of up to $250,000 per violation may be
imposed administratively.

Regulation K, International Banking
Organizations—12 CFR 211

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System’s Regulation K, Subpart B was issued
under the authority of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act of 1956 (BHCA) and the International
Banking Act of 1978 (IBA). It applies to FBOs
with respect to:

• limitations on interstate banking;
• exemptions from the nonbanking prohibitions

of the BHCA and the IBA;
• the approval of the establishment of an office

of a foreign bank in the U.S.;
• the termination of a foreign bank’s branch or

agency;
• the examination of an office of a foreign bank

in the U.S.;
• the disclosure of supervisory information to a

foreign supervisor; and
• the limitations on loans to one borrower by

state branches and state agencies of a foreign
bank.

The following is a brief summary of Regula-
tion K:

Section 211.21—Definitions

This section includes all the definitions for this
subpart. Included in this section is the definition
of agency and credit balances. Refer to the
Deposit Accounts section of this manual for
additional information on credit balances.

Section 211.22—Limitation on Interstate
Banking

This section addresses the designation of a home
state for the foreign organization. The Federal
Reserve Bank District in which a foreign orga-
nization’s home state is located, is considered
the organization’s ‘‘responsible Reserve Bank.’’

Section 211.23—Nonbanking Activities of
FBOs

This section exempts certain FBOs from the
nonbanking prohibitions of the BHCA and IBA.
An organization must qualify for exemption
from these prohibitions by meeting certain asset,
revenue, and net income requirements. If an
organization does not meet the qualifications, or
ceases to be eligible for the exemption, the
organization may apply to the Federal Reserve
Board for a specific determination of its eligi-
bility. Refer to the regulation for details. If an
organization qualifies for this exemption, it may
engage in certain activities and investments
cited in the regulation. Refer to the regulation
for a listing of such activities and investments.

Section 211.24—Approval of Offices of
Foreign Banks; Procedures for
Applications; Standards for Approval;
Representative-Office Activities and
Standards of Approval; Preservation of
Existing Authority

This section addresses the application proce-
dures and approval process for branches, agen-
cies, representative offices, and commercial lend-
ing companies of foreign banks. The section
also lists the activities in which a representative
office may engage. In addition, this section
requires uninsured federal and state branches,
uninsured state branches, all state agencies, and
all representative offices to file a suspicious
activity report in accordance with the Federal
Reserve Board’s Regulation H.

Section 211.25—Termination of Offices of
Foreign Banks

This section addresses the grounds under which
a foreign bank may be required to terminate the
activities of its representative office, commercial
lending company subsidiary, or state branch or
agency. The section also includes termination
procedures. The license of a federal branch or
agency would be terminated by the OCC. A
state branch or agency license can only be
terminated by the respective state’s banking
authority.

Section 211.26—Examination of Offices
and Affiliates of Foreign Banks

This section requires an annual on-site exami-
nation of each branch, agency, or commercial
lending company of a foreign bank by:

• the Federal Reserve Board;

• the FDIC, if the branch is FDIC insured;

• the OCC, if the branch or agency is licensed
by the Comptroller; or

• the state supervisor, if the branch or agency is
licensed by the state.

To the extent possible, these examinations
should be coordinated with all the regulatory
agencies; and the examination of all U.S. offices
of the FBO should be conducted simultaneously.

Section 211.27—Disclosure of Supervisory
Information to Foreign Supervisors

As the title suggests, this section addresses the
disclosure of information to a foreign banking
regulatory or supervisory authority. Refer to the
regulation for details.

Section 211.28—Limitation on Loans to
One Borrower

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
aggregate of all outstanding loans and exten-
sions of credit at one time to a single borrower
by all state and federal branches and agencies of
the same FBO are subject to the limitations and
other provisions of section 5200 of the Revised
Statutes (12 USC 84). Section 5200 of the
Revised Statutes (12 USC 84) limits loans and
extensions of credit to a person outstanding at
one time which are not fully secured, to 15% per-
cent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus for the association. Separate from and in
addition to this 15% limitation, loans and exten-
sions of credit to a person outstanding at one
time which are fully secured by readily market-
able collateral having a market value, are limited
to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus of the association. In the case of a
branch, the ‘‘unimpaired capital and unimpaired
surplus of the association’’ is the unimpaired
capital and unimpaired surplus of the FBO as
reported on the FBO’s Annual Report of FBO
(FR Y-7). Section 5200 allows for some exemp-
tions to these limits; however, the examiner
should place the burden of proof upon the
branch to justify qualifications for these
exemptions.

Regulation D, Reserve Requirements
of Depository Institutions—
12 CFR 204

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System’s Regulation D was issued under the
authority of section 19 (12 USC 461) and other
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and of
section 7 of the IBA (12 USC 3105). The
regulation relates to the reserves that depository
institutions are required to maintain. The reserve
requirements apply to a foreign bank’s branch or
agency located in the U.S., in the following
instances:

Other Compliance Matters 5070.1

• its parent bank has total worldwide consoli-
dated bank assets in excess of $1 billion;

• its parent bank is controlled by a foreign
company or group of foreign companies that
own or control foreign banks that in the
aggregate have total worldwide consolidated
bank assets in excess of $1 billion; or

• the branch is eligible to apply to become a
FDIC-insured bank.

Refer to the regulation for information on the
calculation and maintenance of reserves. Sec-
tion 5060 of this manual also addresses the
regulatory reports required to calculate reserves.
The examiner assigned the review of regulatory
reports should determine whether any violations
of Regulation D exist.

Bank Secrecy Act—31 USC 5311, et
seq. and 31 CFR Part 103, et seq./
Regulation H, Section 208.14

Refer to the Federal Reserve System’s Bank
Secrecy Act Manual for information on these
rules and regulations.

Transfer Agent Activities

If a branch acts as a transfer agent for the stock
of its holding company or any other equity
security, it may have to register with the Board
of Governors as a transfer agent, pursuant to the
requirements of Regulation H (section 208.8(f)),
by filing uniform interagency Form TA-1. A
discussion of the responsibilities of a branch as
a transfer agent, the reports and filing require-
ments, and other information, including exami-
nation procedures, are contained in the Board’s
Transfer Agent Examination Manual. The Board
has developed a separate Report of Examination
of Transfer Agents.

Municipal Securities Dealer Activities

A branch that is a municipal securities dealer
must register with the SEC and with the Board
as a municipal securities dealer, pursuant to SEC
Rule 15Ba2-1, by filing Form MSD. A discus-
sion of the responsibilities as a municipal secu-
rities dealer, filing requirements, and other
information, including examination procedures,

is contained in the Board’s Municipal Securities
Dealer Examination Manual. The Board has
developed a separate Report of Examination of
Municipal Securities Dealer Activities.

Government Securities Broker and Dealer
Activities

If a branch acts as a government securities
broker and/or dealer, it may have to file notice
with the Board as a government securities bro-
ker and/or dealer pursuant to section 15C(a)(1)(B)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by filing
Form FR G-FIN. A discussion of the branch’s
responsibilities as a government securities bro-
ker and/or dealer, filing requirements, and other
information, including examination procedures
is contained in the Board’s Procedures for the
Examination of Government Securities Activi-
ties. The Board has developed a separate Sum-
mary Report of Examination of Government
Securities Broker/Dealer or Custodial Activities.

Lost and Stolen Securities Reporting
and Inquiry Requirements—
17 CFR 240.17F-1

A branch with deposits insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (reporting insti-
tution) must register with the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s designee, Securities
Information Center, Inc. (SIC) and report lost,
missing, stolen, or counterfeit securities to the
SIC. Each insured branch is responsible for
contacting the SIC to determine if securities
coming into its possession, whether by pledge,
transfer or some other manner, have been pre-
viously reported as missing, lost, stolen,
or counterfeit, except in certain limited
circumstances.

All functions within a branch that handle or
process securities are subject to the reporting
requirements. Only the transfer agent function is
exempt from the inquiry requirements. Accord-
ingly, all branch departments likely to be
affected, including the trust, investment, transfer
agent, custody or dealer departments, and the
lending operations as relating to margin loans,
should be familiar with the requirements set out
in 17 CFR 240.17F-1.

Securities exempt from the reporting require-
ments are:

5070.1 Other Compliance Matters

September 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual
Page 8


• Registered securities of the U.S. government
and federal agencies thereof;

• Securities that have not been assigned CUSIP
numbers; and,

• Bond coupons.

Securities exempt from the inquiry require-
ments are:

• Securities received directly from the issuer or
its agent at issuance;

• Securities received from another reporting
institution or from a Federal Reserve Bank or
branch;

• Securities received from a customer of the
reporting institution in the name of the cus-
tomer or nominee; and,

• Securities that are a part of a transaction of
$10,000 or less (aggregate face value for
bonds or market value for stocks).

Reporting Lost, Missing, Stolen or
Counterfeit Securities

Form X-17F-1A must be filed with the SIC
within one business day after the discovery of:

• A theft or loss of any security, when there is a
substantial indication of criminal activity;

• A security that has been lost or missing for
two business days; or

• A security that is counterfeit.

The form must be filed within two business
days of notification of nonreceipt when
(1) delivery of securities sent by the branch is
made by mail or by draft and payment is not
received within ten business days and confirma-
tion of nondelivery has been made by the
receiving institution and (2) delivery is made in
person and no receipt is maintained by the
branch. If securities sent by the branch, either in
person or through a clearing agency, are lost in
transit and the certificate numbers of the secu-
rities can be determined, the branch must supply
the receiving institution with the certificate num-
bers of the securities within two business days
from the date of the request from the receiving
institution. The delivery of lost or missing
securities to the branch must be reported within
one business day after discovery and notification
of certificate numbers. Securities that are con-
sidered lost or missing as a result of counts or
verifications must be reported no later than ten

business days after discovery or as soon as
certificate numbers can be ascertained.

Copies of all reports required to be filed under
17 CFR 240.17F-1 must also be submitted to the
registered transfer agent for the issue being
reported and, if criminal activities are suspected,
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Copies of
filed or received Forms X-17F-1A must be
maintained in an easily accessible place for
three years.

CONSUMER COMPLIANCE
REGULATIONS

Since the late 1960s, Congress has enacted a
number of consumer protection and civil rights
laws directly related to the activities of financial
institutions. Traditionally, these laws have been
enforced by the domestic institution’s primary
federal regulator; for example, the Board of
Governors conducts consumer compliance
examinations for state member banks. More
recently, as part of the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,
Congress expanded the authority of the Board
and other federal banking agencies to enforce
consumer statutes for certain types of FBOs.

Specifically, the Federal Reserve System is
responsible for enforcing consumer laws in the
case of state-licensed agencies and state-licensed
uninsured branches of FBOs, commercial lend-
ing companies owned or controlled by FBOs
and organizations operating under section 25 or
25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (Edge Act and
Agreement corporations). In addition, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency is respon-
sible for conducting these examinations for
federally-licensed, uninsured branches of FBOs
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is responsible for federally-insured branches of
FBOs.

The scope of a typical compliance examina-
tion for these institutions includes the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collec-
tion Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the
Expedited Funds Availability Act. The degree to
which FBOs operating in the U.S. conduct
activities covered by these laws and regulations
vary, but often these institutions conduct far
fewer such activities than a typical domestically-
chartered bank.

Other Compliance Matters 5070.1

Branch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997
Page 9


Examinations of entities of FBOs should be
conducted using existing regulatory policies and
procedures for domestically-chartered bank com-
pliance examinations. Examiner guidelines for
conducting compliance examinations and inves-
tigating consumer complaints are contained, for
example, in the Board of Governor’s Consumer
Compliance Handbook and various supervisory
Consumer Affairs letters. These guidelines
describe the examination procedures to be used
in connection with loan file sampling, reporting
and correcting violations, and rating branches
for compliance. Of particular importance are
violations that require reimbursement of over-
charges and violations that trigger corrective
action under the Board’s Regulation B/Fair
Housing Act Policy Guide.

Following is a description of some of the
regulations and consumer protection laws that
Federal Reserve System examiners enforce. This
information is provided primarily as reference
material; examiners should consult the detailed
handbooks mentioned earlier for specific exami-
nation guidance in this area.

Regulation B/Equal Credit
Opportunity Act

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits
discrimination against an applicant for credit
because of age, sex, marital status, religion,
race, color, national origin, or receipt of public
assistance. It also prohibits discrimination
because of a good faith exercise of any rights
under the federal consumer credit laws. The law
also contains notification requirements for con-
sumers and small businesses that have been
denied credit.

Regulation C/Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires
certain lending branches to report annually on
their originations and purchases of home pur-
chase and home improvement loans and appli-
cations for such loans. The type of loan, location
of property, race or national origin, sex, and
income of the applicant or borrower are reported
to supervisory agencies. Branches are required
to make information regarding their lending

available to the public and must post a notice of
availability in their public lobby.

Regulation E/Electronic Funds
Transfer Act

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act provides
consumer protection for all transactions using a
debit card or other electronic means to debit or
credit an account. For example, it also limits a
consumer’s liability for unauthorized electronic
fund transfers, restricts issuance of debit cards,
and requires certain disclosures.

Regulation Z/Truth In Lending Act

Regulation Z implements the federal Truth in
Lending Act, which is contained in Title I of the
Consumer Protection Act and Section 1204 of
the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987.

The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure
of certain costs and terms of credit including the
finance charge and the annual percentage rate so
that a consumer can compare the prices of credit
from different sources. It also limits liability on
lost or stolen credit cards. In addition, it pro-
vides consumers the right to cancel certain
home-secured loans. Over the years, the Truth in
Lending Act has been amended by several acts.
A summary of the provisions of each of the Acts
follows.

Consumer Leasing Act

The Consumer Leasing Act requires disclosure
of certain costs and terms of consumer leases, so
that consumers can compare the prices of leas-
ing from different sources.

Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure
Act

The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act
requires disclosures on (1) credit and charge
cards and (2) applications and pre-approved
solicitations for cards, whether issued by finan-
cial institutions, retail stores, or private compa-
nies. Information such as APRs, annual fees,
and grace periods must be provided in tabular
form. The Act also requires card issuers that

5070.1 Other Compliance Matters

September 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual
Page 10


impose an annual fee to provide disclosures
before annual renewal. In addition, card issuers
that offer credit insurance must inform custom-
ers of any increase in rate or substantial decrease
in coverage should the issuer decide to change
insurance providers.

Fair Credit Billing Act

The Fair Credit Billing Act establishes proce-
dures for the prompt correction of errors on
open-end credit accounts. It also protects a
consumer’s credit rating while the consumer is
settling any disputes.

Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection
Act

The Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection
Act requires lenders to disclose terms, rates, and
conditions (APR, miscellaneous charges, pay-
ment terms, and information about variable rate
features) for home equity lines of credit with the
applications and before the first transaction under
the home equity plan. If the disclosed terms
change, the consumer can refuse to open the
plan and is entitled to a refund of fees paid in
connection with the application. The Act also
limits the circumstances under which creditors
may terminate or change the terms of a home
equity plan after it is opened.

Regulation AA/Credit Practices Rule
(issued under the Federal Trade
Commission Act)

The Credit Practices Rule prohibits lenders from
using certain remedies such as confessions of
judgement; exemption waivers; wage assign-
ments; and nonpossessory, nonpurchase money,
security interests in household goods in connec-
tion with consumer credit contracts. The rule
also prohibits lenders from misrepresenting a
cosigner’s liability and requires that lenders

provide cosigners with a notice explaining their
credit obligation as a cosigner. It also prohibits
the pyramiding of late charges.

Regulation CC/Expedited Funds
Availability Act

The Expedited Funds Availability Act requires
that all banks (including branches of FBOs),
savings and loan associations, savings banks,
and credit unions to make funds deposited into
checking, share draft, and NOW accounts avail-
able according to specified time schedules, and
to disclose their funds availability policies to
their customers. The law does not require an
institution to delay the customer’s use of depos-
ited funds but instead limits how long any delay
may last. The regulation also establishes rules
designed to speed the return of unpaid checks.

Fair Credit Reporting Act

The Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes pro-
cedures for correcting mistakes on a person’s
credit record and requires that a consumer’s
record only be provided for legitimate business
needs. It also requires that the record be kept
confidential. A credit record may be retained
seven years for judgements, liens, suits, and
other adverse information, except for bankrupt-
cies, which may be retained ten years. If a
consumer has been denied credit, a cost-free
credit report may be requested within 30 days of
denial.

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is
designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and
unfair debt collection practices. It applies to
third party debt collectors or those who use a
name other than their own in collecting con-
sumer debts.
