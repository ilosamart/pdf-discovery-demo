financial stability risks from the broader economy, financial markets, and other sources.  

The LISCC also builds on the comprehensive analysis of financial stability by the 

Board’s Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which was established after 

the financial crisis.  

The Federal Reserve has significant responsibilities for supervising large financial 

institutions, but we cannot guarantee their stability on our own.  It is important that we 

communicate and coordinate with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies with 

responsibilities that affect the safety and soundness of large institutions.  We also need to 

cooperate with supervisors in other countries where these firms operate.  This 

cooperation helps us understand developments in a complex and global financial system 

that have implications for individual firms or for large institutions generally.  It can also 

provide information and perspective about firms whose supervision we may share with 

other agencies or governments.  In addition, it facilitates a coordinated approach to 

ensuring that large firms are operating in a safe and sound manner.  

To be effective, regulation and supervision must be independent of the entities 

subject to oversight.  You may know or have heard the term “regulatory capture.”  

Regulatory capture is when a regulatory agency advances the interests of the industry it is 

supposed to oversee rather than the broader public interest it should represent.11  

Regulatory capture, which may occur in the oversight of any industry, can happen in both 

intentional and inadvertent ways.  The most blatant ways involve tangible conflicts of 

interest--for example the expectation government officials might have of future rewards 

11 A body of economic literature addresses regulatory capture, with perhaps one of the most influential 
works being George J. Stigler (1971), “The Theory of Economic Regulation,” Bell Journal of Economics 
and Management Science, vol. 2 (Spring), pp. 3-21.  See also Ernesto Dal Bó (2006), “Regulatory Capture:  
A Review,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 22 (Summer), pp. 203-25.
