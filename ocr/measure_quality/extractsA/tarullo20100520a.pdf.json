It is thus important to understand the \n\nevolution of the financial turmoil in Europe, the European policy response, and the implications \n\nfor the United States.  After presenting some views on these subjects, I will describe the action \n\ntaken by the Federal Reserve last week in support of efforts to contain the crisis.  \n\nEvolution of the Crisis in Europe and the European Policy Response \n\nAlthough the sovereign debt crisis in Europe may have appeared to erupt virtually \n\novernight, its origins were long in the making.  For years many market participants had assumed \n\nthat an implicit guarantee protected the debt of euro-area members.  For a number of euro-area \n\ncountries, including those most under pressure now, this presumption may have led to a systematic \n\nunderpricing of risk, which made debt cheaper to issue than it probably should have been.  \n\nAlthough strictures against excessive fiscal deficits and debts were built into the Maastricht \n\nTreaty, the European Union (EU) has had relatively weak mechanisms to enforce them, as EU \n\nofficials themselves have recently acknowledged.   Little provision was made for fiscal transfers \n\nacross members of the euro area in the event that financial support for members became necessary.  \n\nThe global financial crisis created an environment in which the presumed EU guarantee was more \n\nlikely to be tested, as stimulus measures and lost revenue led to sizable fiscal deficits and the rapid \n\naccumulation of debt across euro-area members. \n\n Nowhere were these problems with the EU’s fiscal framework more evident than in \n\nGreece.  Greece’s entry into the euro area in 2001 was associated with a sharp decline in Greek \n\n\n\n- 2 - \n \ngovernment borrowing costs.  Remarkably, the spread of Greek 10-year bond yields over those on \n\nGerman bonds fell below 30 basis points for a number of years.  Despite these low borrowing \n\ncosts, Greece was consistently unable to meet EU budget deficit targets or to reduce its sizable \n\ndebt, putting the government’s finances in a very precarious position at the onset of the global \n\nfinancial crisis.     \n\n Many date the start of the acute phase of the current problems to the revelation last fall that \n\nthe Greek government’s deficit for 2009 was likely to be several times larger than previously \n\nthought--it is now estimated at near 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)--and that its debt \n\nwould significantly exceed 100 percent of GDP.  In response, the Greek government announced \n\nsubstantial fiscal consolidation plans involving sizable increases in revenue and sharp wage cuts \n\nfor government workers.  However, concerns about the plan’s feasibility, especially as growth \n\nprospects worsened, combined with what financial market participants took to be inconsistent \n\nsignals from other European countries about the possibility of support, undermined the market’s \n\nbelief in an implicit guarantee.  As a result, a sharp widening of spreads, rating downgrades of \n\nGreek debt, and stresses in the Greek banking system followed.  By mid-April, it was clear that \n\nGreek financial institutions and the Greek government were rapidly losing access to market \n\nfinancing, just as sizable redemptions on the government’s debt were looming.   \n\n After attempts at smaller and less well-defined support mechanisms for Greece failed to \n\nstabilize markets, EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) leaders announced on May 2 a joint \n\n€110 billion support package.  This international financing package is the largest ever extended to \n\na single country and amounts to about 50 percent of Greece’s GDP.  In return, Greece was \n\nexpected to implement an aggressive, front-loaded consolidation program to reduce its budget \n\ndeficit from double-digit rates to less than 3 percent of GDP between now and 2014, with one-half \n\nof that reduction occurring this year alone. \n\n\n\n- 3 - \n \n  The announcement of this package did not stave off market pressures, and by then the \n\nconcerns of investors had already moved well beyond Greece.  Doubts about the feasibility of the \n\ncontemplated pace of Greek fiscal consolidation and concerns about the fiscal and financial \n\nsituation in other vulnerable euro-area countries, especially Portugal and Spain, combined to move \n\nthe situation closer to a crisis.  Pressures were also beginning to be felt in dollar funding markets \n\nin Europe.  Nascent signs of dollar shortages, a shortening of lending tenors on the interbank \n\nmarket, and increasing concerns about counterparty risk for many European financial institutions \n\nbrought back memories of developments during the recent global financial crisis.  More visible \n\nwas the sharp decline in the euro in foreign exchange markets and plunging stock markets \n\nworldwide.      \n\n  In response to these rapidly deteriorating financial conditions, in the early hours of \n\nMonday, May 10, European leaders announced a much broader package of  stabilization measures \n\nthan that previously announced for Greece alone.  \n\n One set of initiatives addresses sovereign risk.   The European leaders announced the \n\nestablishment of a European Financial Stabilization mechanism that would be based on up to €60 \n\nbillion in European Commission funding and a special purpose vehicle that could raise up to €440 \n\nbillion in additional funds in capital markets with guarantees provided by member state \n\ngovernments.  Moreover, the IMF stated that it stood ready to cooperate with the EU, in \n\naccordance with established IMF lending programs and procedures, if requested by euro-area \n\nmembers.  According to the EU, total available support through loans and credit lines, including \n\npotential bilateral IMF loans to member countries, could be as large as €750 billion \n\n(approximately $900 billion).  In addition, the EU and the IMF announced final approval and \n\nfunding for the earlier announced Greek rescue package in an effort to assuage concerns about the \n\ncountry’s financing needs.   \n\n\n\n- 4 - \n \n Another set of initiatives addresses market liquidity.  Specifically, the European Central \n\nBank (ECB) announced that it was prepared to purchase government and private debt securities to \n\nensure the depth and liquidity of euro area debt markets that were considered dysfunctional.  In \n\naddition, the ECB expanded its liquidity provision facilities, including offering full-allotment \n\noperations for three- and six-month loans.  Finally, as I will discuss in more detail later, to \n\nforestall an emerging shortage of dollar liquidity, the Federal Reserve reopened temporary U.S. \n\ndollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and other major central banks. \n\n The effect of the announcement on bond markets was immediate.  Bond spreads for the \n\nperipheral European countries narrowed substantially, at least partly reflecting purchases of \n\ngovernment securities by euro-area central banks.  The ECB’s enhanced liquidity provisions, \n\nincluding dollar credit from the liquidity swaps, have contained stresses in the European interbank \n\nmarket and provided an important backstop for these markets.  Stock markets also initially \n\nrebounded strongly following the announcement of the European package; however, their declines \n\nover the past week serve as a reminder that investors are aware that this package cannot ultimately \n\nrelieve the need for real, and likely painful, fiscal reforms in some euro-area countries.    \n\nPotential Ramifications for the U.S. Economy \n\nFinancial markets in the United States have been buffeted by the European problems.  \n\nOver the four-week period leading up to May 6, just prior to news that EU members would be \n\nmeeting to craft the most recent package, broad U.S. stock price indexes declined and implied \n\nvolatility on equities rose sharply, reflecting some increased aversion to risk.  The flight to quality \n\nalso showed through to U.S. Treasury yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, with the \n\n10-year Treasury yield declining 50 basis points over the four-week period and the dollar climbing \n\nmore than six percent against the euro.  Following the announcement of the May 10 package, \n\n\n\n- 5 - \n \nTreasury yields moved back up slightly and equity prices rebounded, but these moves were \n\nsubsequently reversed and the dollar rose further against the euro.    \n\nThese effects on U.S. markets underscore the high degree of integration of the U.S. and \n\nEuropean economies and highlight the risks to the United States of renewed financial stresses in \n\nEurope.  One avenue through which financial turmoil in Europe might affect the U.S. economy is \n\nby weakening the asset quality and capital positions of U.S. financial institutions.  There are, to be \n\nsure, good reasons to believe that these institutions can withstand some fallout from European \n\nfinancial difficulties.  In the past year, the Federal Reserve has pressed the largest financial \n\ninstitutions to raise substantial additional capital.  Moreover, the direct effect on U.S. banks of \n\nlosses on exposure to one or more sovereigns in peripheral Europe--which, in the current context \n\nof sovereign debt concerns, is generally understood to mean Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and \n\nItaly--would be small.  According to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, \n\nalmost all U.S. exposure to peripheral European sovereigns is held by 10 large U.S. bank holding \n\ncompanies, whose balance sheet exposure of $60 billion represents only 9 percent of their Tier 1 \n\ncapital.1\n\n In addition to imposing direct losses on U.S. institutions, a heightening of financial stresses \n\nin Europe could be transmitted to financial markets globally.  Increases in uncertainty and risk \n\n  However, if sovereign problems in peripheral Europe were to spill over to cause \n\ndifficulties more broadly throughout Europe, U.S. banks would face larger losses on their \n\nconsiderable overall credit exposures, as the value of traded assets declined and loan delinquencies \n\nmounted.  U.S. money market mutual funds and other institutions, which hold a large amount of \n\ncommercial paper and certificates of deposit issued by European banks, would likely also be \n\naffected.   \n\n                                                 \n1 See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, “E.16 Country Exposure Lending Survey and  \nCountry Exposure Information Report,” http://www.ffiec.gov/E16.htm. \n\n\n\n- 6 - \n \naversion could lead to higher funding costs and liquidity shortages for some institutions, and \n\nforced asset sales and reductions in collateral values that could, in turn, engender further market \n\nturmoil.  In these conditions, U.S. banks and other institutions might be forced to pull back on \n\ntheir lending, as they did during the period of severe financial market dysfunction that followed \n\nthe bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.  The timing of such an event in the current instance would be \n\nunfortunate, as banks generally have only recently ceased tightening lending standards, and have \n\nyet to unwind from the considerable tightening that has occurred over the past two years.  \n\nMoreover, aggregate bank lending, particularly to businesses, continues to contract.  The result \n\nwould be another source of risk to the U.S. recovery in an environment of still-fragile balance \n\nsheets and considerable slack.  Although we view such a development as unlikely, the swoon in \n\nglobal financial markets earlier this month suggests that it is not out of the question.    \n\nAnother means by which an intensification of financial turmoil in Europe could affect U.S. \n\ngrowth is by reducing trade.  Collectively, Europe represents one of our most important trading \n\npartners and accounts for about one-quarter of U.S. merchandise exports.  Accordingly, a \n\nmoderate economic slowdown across Europe would cause U.S. export growth to fall, weighing on \n\nU.S. economic performance by a discernible, but modest extent.  However, a deeper contraction in \n\nEurope associated with sharp financial dislocations would have the potential to stall the recovery \n\nof the entire global economy, and this scenario would have far more serious consequences for U.S. \n\ntrade and economic growth.  A resultant slowdown in the United States and abroad would likely \n\nalso feed back into the health of U.S. financial institutions. \n\nFederal Reserve Responses to the Crisis \n\nNotwithstanding the fact that European sovereign debt problems could have negative \n\nconsequences for U.S. and global economic growth, successful resolution of these problems \n\nultimately rests predominantly on effective European policy actions.  The Federal Reserve has \n\n\n\n- 7 - \n \nonly a limited, though important, role to play by helping to prevent liquidity pressures from \n\nintensifying and leading to a more widespread freezing up of financial markets, including in the \n\nUnited States.  To counter growing strains in dollar funding markets in Europe, last week the \n\nFederal Reserve re-established dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of foreign central banks \n\nfollowing the receipt of information on the large support package developed by European leaders.2\n\nThe liquidity lines, which were authorized by a unanimous vote of the Federal Open \n\nMarket Committee, are structured similarly to those that were put in place during the financial \n\ncrisis.  As you know, central bank swap transactions have a long and well-established history, and \n\ntheir use by the Federal Reserve and other central banks goes back to the Bretton Woods era of \n\nfixed exchange rates.  In their current vintage, they are used by foreign central banks to relieve or \n\nforestall temporary liquidity pressures in their local dollar funding markets.  Foreign central banks \n\ndraw on these lines by selling foreign currency to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars.  \n\nThe foreign central banks then lend these dollars to financial institutions in their jurisdictions.  At \n\nmaturity, the foreign central bank returns the dollars back to the Federal Reserve in exchange for \n\nits own currency at the same exchange rate that prevailed at the time of the initial draw, and pays \n\ninterest as well.   \n\n       \n\nThe loans provided by the foreign central banks to institutions abroad are offered at rates \n\nthat would be above market rates in normal times.  As such, when market conditions are not \n\ngreatly strained, demand for dollar liquidity through the swap lines should not be high, as market \n\nalternatives would be more attractive.  Likely for that reason, the dollar liquidity offerings by \n\n                                                 \n2 Swap facilities were reestablished with central banks in Europe (the ECB, the Bank of England, and the Swiss \nNational Bank), Japan (the Bank of Japan), and Canada (the Bank of Canada).  The agreements establishing these \nfacilities can be seen at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Central Bank Liquidity Swaps,” webpage, \nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/liquidity_swap.html.     \n\n\n\n- 8 - \n \nforeign central banks to date have elicited only a modest demand.3\n\nEven if usage increases significantly, the risks to the Federal Reserve, and by implication \n\nthe risks to the U.S. taxpayer, are minimal.  U.S. interests are safeguarded by the foreign currency \n\nheld by the Federal Reserve during the term of the swap.  Moreover, our exposures are not to the \n\ninstitutions in the foreign countries ultimately receiving the dollar liquidity but to the foreign \n\ncentral banks.  Over the life of the previous temporary swap program (from December 2007 to \n\nFebruary 2010), all swaps were repaid in full, and the Federal Reserve earned $5.8 billion in \n\ninterest.  Finally, the Federal Reserve bears no market pricing risk in these drawings, since the \n\nswaps are designed so that fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates have no effect on the \n\npayments made at the end of the transaction.      \n\n  However, even in such \n\ninstances, the existence of these facilities can reassure market participants that funds will be \n\navailable in case of need, and thus help forestall hoarding of liquidity, a feature that exacerbated \n\nstresses during the global financial crisis.   \n\nConclusion \n\n The agreement of the Federal Reserve to reinstate foreign exchange swap arrangements \n\nwas designed not to insulate banks and investors from losses they may incur, but as a prudent \n\neffort to help minimize the risk of financial turmoil in Europe, with the consequences that would \n\nensue for the global financial system, including the United States.  In the worst case, such turmoil \n\ncould lead to a replay of the freezing up of financial markets that we witnessed in 2008.  With \n\nunemployment remaining quite high, and with continued need for balance sheet repair by many \n\nbusinesses, financial institutions, and households, it is particularly important that the United States \n\nnot sustain a significant external shock.   \n\n                                                 \n3 Amounts outstanding on the swap lines are posted weekly at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Federal Reserve \nForeign Exchange Swap Agreements,” webpage, www.newyorkfed.org/markets/fxswap. \n\n\n\n- 9 - \n \n\nThe policy measures announced by European authorities a week and a half ago elicited a \n\nquick, strongly favorable market reaction, holding out hope that further financial disruptions can \n\nbe averted.  However, as reflected in the negative turn of equity markets later in the week, and \n\ncontinued tight funding in some European markets, uncertainties are still clouding financial \n\nmarkets.  Market participants continue to seek clarification of the terms and scope of the measures \n\nbroadly outlined by the relevant European countries and institutions.   \n\nIn Europe, a key near-term priority is to continue work to prevent a drying up of liquidity \n\nby providing both euro-denominated and, through the dollar liquidity swaps, dollar-denominated \n\ncredit to financial institutions.  But, even if effectively implemented, this support, along with the \n\nsupport for sovereign debt markets provided by the other components of the EU package, will not \n\nsolve the sovereign debt problems; it will only provide time to make necessary policy adjustments.  \n\nLasting beneficial effects will require credible action to bring fiscal deficits under control.  For the \n\nEU as a whole, it seems clear that the mechanisms of the European Economic and Monetary \n\nUnion need further development if it is to achieve its intended aims.   Last week, the European \n\nCommission issued a communiqué outlining plans to enhance surveillance and develop a crisis \n\nmanagement framework.  I would anticipate a robust debate over these and related matters in the \n\ncoming months. \n\nThe United States is in a very different position from that of the European countries whose \n\ndebt instruments have been under such pressure.  But their experience is another reminder, if one \n\nwere needed, that every country with sustained budget deficits and rising debt--including the \n\nUnited States--needs to act in a timely manner to put in place a credible program for sustainable \n\nfiscal policies. \n\nThank you very much; I would be pleased to answer any questions. \n\n\n","X-TIKA:content_handler":"ToTextContentHandler","X-TIKA:digest:MD5":"02ac57f2ef5c2e4a4b7785f86fda060d","X-TIKA:embedded_depth":"0","X-TIKA:parse_time_millis":"1076","access_permission:assemble_document":"true","access_permission:can_modify":"true","access_permission:can_print":"true","access_permission:can_print_degraded":"true","access_permission:extract_content":"true","access_permission:extract_for_accessibility":"true","access_permission:fill_in_form":"true","access_permission:modify_annotations":"true","created":"2010-05-19T22:44:56Z","creator":"Federal Reserve Board","date":"2010-05-19T22:57:59Z","dc:creator":"Federal Reserve Board","dc:format":"application/pdf; version\u003d1.6","dc:title":"Testimony: Governor Tarullo on International Response to European Debt Problems","dcterms:created":"2010-05-19T22:44:56Z","dcterms:modified":"2010-05-19T22:57:59Z","meta:author":"Federal Reserve Board","meta:creation-date":"2010-05-19T22:44:56Z","meta:save-date":"2010-05-19T22:57:59Z","modified":"2010-05-19T22:57:59Z","pdf:PDFVersion":"1.6","pdf:charsPerPage":["362","2144","2146","2055","2112","2216","2188","2295","2129","1996"],"pdf:docinfo:created":"2010-05-19T22:44:56Z","pdf:docinfo:creator":"Federal Reserve Board","pdf:docinfo:creator_tool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 9.1 for Word","pdf:docinfo:custom:Company":"FRB_IF","pdf:docinfo:custom:SourceModified":"D:20100519224450","pdf:docinfo:modified":"2010-05-19T22:57:59Z","pdf:docinfo:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 9.0","pdf:docinfo:title":"Testimony: Governor Tarullo on International Response to European Debt Problems","pdf:encrypted":"false","pdf:hasMarkedContent":"true","pdf:hasXFA":"false","pdf:hasXMP":"true","pdf:unmappedUnicodeCharsPerPage":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"producer":"Adobe PDF Library 9.0","resourceName":"tarullo20100520a.pdf","tika:file_ext":"pdf","tika_batch_fs:relative_path":"tarullo20100520a.pdf","title":"Testimony: Governor Tarullo on International Response to European Debt Problems","xmp:CreatorTool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 9.1 for Word","xmpMM:DocumentID":"uuid:099c6468-cfde-4345-b231-70b2bd105b54","xmpTPg:NPages":"10"}]
