The\ncompliance officer should be qualified and\nfamiliar with U.S. and state laws and regulations.\n\nBranch management and the compliance offi-\ncer should ensure that all appropriate personnel\n\nare properly trained in meeting regulatory\nrequirements on an ongoing basis. In addition,\nthe training program should ensure that branch\npersonnel are informed of U.S. and state laws\nand regulations to which the branch may be\nsubject.\n\nThe scope of the branch’s audit function also\nshould ensure that the branch is meeting all\napplicable regulatory requirements. The head\noffice should ensure that the audit team is\nqualified to audit its U.S. branch operations for\ncompliance with U.S. and state laws, regula-\ntions, and regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nFinancial Recordkeeping and Reporting Regulations\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5010.1\n\nInformation, plus the examination objectives\nand examination procedures relating to this\nsection are available in the Federal Reserve\n\nBoard’s Bank Secrecy Act Manual and other\nsimilar examination material of the other federal\nand state banking agencies.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nAsset Maintenance\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5020.1\n\nAsset maintenance was originally developed as\na method of ensuring that, in the event of a\nliquidation, sufficient assets would be available\nto effect repayment to depositors and liability\nholders. Although asset maintenance is not a\ncapital equivalent, branches under asset mainte-\nnance have some of the characteristics of a\nseparately capitalized entity. In fact, in the early\nstages of asset maintenance, ratios of 108 per-\ncent and 105 percent were established to be\nroughly equivalent to the then-prevailing capital\nratios of U.S. domestic banks.\n\nGenerally, asset maintenance is defined as the\nmaintenance of eligible assets in a branch in a\nparticular state, covering a specified percent-\nage of a branch’s third party liabilities. The\nasset maintenance calculation is determined by\ndividing eligible assets by liabilities requiring\ncover.\n\nAsset maintenance is generally defined and\nenforced by the licensing agency. Examiners\nshould consult the appropriate regulation of the\nappropriate agency to define and calculate the\nratio. Asset maintenance may also be imposed\nby regulators through the issuance of supervi-\nsory action. The supervisory imposition of asset\nmaintenance has significant effects on the branch\ndepending upon the percentage imposed. When\nimposed at levels above 100 percent, a branch\nmust maintain a net due to related parties\nposition at all times. This effectively prevents\nthe branch from providing net funding to the\nhead office or other related offices. Asset main-\ntenance levels below 100 percent would have\nthe effect of limiting the net due from related\nparties position.\n\nAsset maintenance requirements will differ by\nstate. Some states do not require coverage for all\nthird party liabilities booked at the branch (e.g.\nIBF deposits). Therefore, even though a branch\nmeets the state’s asset maintenance require-\nments, the branch may still be in a net due from\naffiliates position. In the event of a financially\nweak FBO, regulators may consider expanding\nthe asset maintenance requirements to further\ndefine eligible assets and liabilities to ensure\nadequate coverage of all third party deposits.\n\nState licensing authorities may impose asset\nmaintenance as a requirement of licensure within\nthat state. The FDIC imposes asset maintenance\nas a requirement for receiving deposit insurance.\n\nAsset maintenance may also be imposed at\nindividual branches or FBO offices as a form of\n\nsupervisory action for the U.S. operations of a\nforeign banking organization. This action may\nrelate to supervisory concerns raised in deter-\nmining the financial strength of the FBO, includ-\ning circumstances in the home country that\ncould adversely affect the FBO’s U.S. opera-\ntions. Asset maintenance, in these instances,\nmay be necessary, even though the U.S. opera-\ntions are in satisfactory condition.\n\nAs a result of statute, regulation, or supervi-\nsory agreement, special requirements and guide-\nlines for determining the amount of eligible\nassets and calculating the asset maintenance\npercentage may be required by the appropriate\nregulatory agency. These requirements will\nnecessitate the maintenance of specific records\nat the branch. A branch under asset maintenance\nwill also be required to periodically report asset\nmaintenance compliance to the appropriate regu-\nlators. Examiners should determine whether the\ndaily record and the monthly report for asset\nmaintenance are appropriately maintained and\nreported.\n\nASSET MAINTENANCE\nCALCULATION\n\nThe first part of the asset maintenance calcula-\ntion requires a determination of eligible assets.\nTo determine eligible assets, the examiner\ndeducts the ineligible assets from the gross asset\nposition of the branch. Ineligible assets fall\ninto two categories: those that are Ineligible\nby Statute, and those that are Ineligible by\nExaminer.\n\nAssets Ineligible By Statute\n\nGenerally, assets that are Ineligible By Statute\nmight include the following:\n\n• Any type of asset not specifically identified as\neligible by statute or regulation by the appro-\npriate licensing agency;\n\n• Any other asset that fails to meet specific\neligibility standards contained in the statute or\nregulation by the appropriate licensing agency.\n\nThe specific assets that are Ineligible By\nStatute will vary according to the requirements\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\ncontained in federal and state laws and regula-\ntions. The following is representative of some of\nthe requirements that may be imposed. Any\nasset for which:\n\n• Evidence of indebtedness (original signed note\nor loan agreement) is not held in the United\nStates or the state within which the branch is\nlicensed;\n\n• Evidence of indebtedness is in transit within\nthe FBO system, either outside the United\nStates or outside the state in which the branch\nis licensed;\n\n• Repayment is to be made in funds not freely\nconvertible to U.S. dollars;\n\n• Reclassification to an expense category is\npending.\n\nIn addition requirements may be imposed on:\n\n• Types of securities and depreciation;\n• The documentation and collection of loans;\n• The type, location, holding, and depreciation\n\nof fixed assets;\n• All amounts due from the head office and\n\nother depository and nondepository offices\nand affiliates, including income accrued but\nuncollected on such amounts.\n\nThe balance of any asset disallowed at the\npreceding examination will be treated as ineli-\ngible until the underlying reasons for the disal-\nlowance have been removed.\n\nAssets Ineligible By Examiner\n\nIf an examiner, during the course of an exami-\nnation, determines that the value of any nonmar-\nketable bond, note, debenture, or any other asset\nwould preclude complete repayment, the exam-\niner may consider that asset ineligible for asset\nmaintenance purposes. The portion considered\nunrecoverable is disallowed.\n\nDisallowances of classified assets will differ\nbased on the criteria or guidelines used by the\nvarious regulatory agencies. The following for-\nmula is representative of some of the disallow-\nances that may be used: Loss—100 percent of\nbook value; Doubtful—50 percent of book value;\nSubstandard—20 percent of book value, and\nValue Impaired—100 percent of the amount\nequivalent to the Allocated Transfer Risk\nReserve, plus 20 percent of any residual expo-\n\nsure. In addition, all accrued interest on assets\nsubject to a Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, or\nValue Impaired classification is usually\ndisallowed.\n\nAn examiner may also disallow any loan or\nother credit exposure that is not supported by\nsufficient credit information (in English) to per-\nmit an evaluation of the creditworthiness or\nother risks inherent in the asset. Examiners are\nto exercise prudence in disallowing assets for\nthis reason.\n\nSituations may arise where an asset can be\ndisallowed for both statutory and discretionary\nreasons. For example, a loan may be disallowed\nby statute because the evidence of indebtedness\nis not held in the state where the branch is\nlocated. Additionally, the loan may be classified\nSubstandard, Doubtful, Loss, or Value Impaired.\nIn this case, the branch (for periodic reporting to\nthe regulators) and/or the examiner can disallow\nthe asset by statute and classify the loan. Of\ncourse, no further disallowance is made on the\nbasis of the asset classification.\n\nWhere an asset is controlled jointly by the\nbranch and a related party, it is necessary to\ndetermine whether the branch has independent\ncontrol ( i.e. the ability to withdraw the asset\nwithout a cosignatory). If so, the item should not\nbe disallowed simply because another office\nretains signing authority.\n\nBy definition, a certificate-less security (those\nrepresented by advises or confirmations) cannot\nbe in the owner’s possession. Nevertheless, this\ntype of security may be an eligible asset, even if\nthe depository is located outside the state where\nthe branch is located, provided that both of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1) The security is\nheld by the depository in the name of the branch\nor in the name of an unrelated broker, agent, or\ncustodian (the exchange member) who is located\nin the state where the branch is licensed; and\n(2) The asset is properly shown on the branch’s\nrecords so as to permit the appropriate regula-\ntors to freeze the account immediately upon\ntaking possession of the branch.\n\nReserves maintained at the local Federal\nReserve Bank, pursuant to Regulation D, and\nassets pledged to the FDIC, in connection with\ndeposit insurance regulations, are eligible assets.\nSecurities held by the Federal Reserve Bank as\ncollateral against possible borrowing are eligible\non the same basis as if held by the branch. The\namount of any borrowing must be deducted\nfrom the value determined.\n\n5020.1 Asset Maintenance\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 2\n\n\n\nLiabilities Requiring Coverage\n\nOnce eligible assets are determined, the asset\nmaintenance computation requires a determina-\ntion of liabilities requiring cover. Generally,\nliabilities requiring cover include all liabilities\nof a branch and may even include certain\ncontingent liabilities, as determined by the\nappropriate regulators. The liabilities will be\nadjusted to exclude the following:\n\n• Amounts due and other liabilities to other\noffices, agencies, branches, and affiliates of\nthe FBO, including unremitted profits;\n\n• Reserves for loan losses and other\ncontingencies;\n\n• Any other liability, as specifically required by\nstatute, regulation, or the appropriate regulators.\n\nAsset Maintenance 5020.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 3\n\n\n\nAsset Maintenance\nExamination Objectives\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5020.2\n\n1. To determine if internal policies, procedures,\nand guidelines regarding asset maintenance\nare adequate.\n\n2. To determine that branch officers and\nemployees are operating in conformance with\nestablished guidelines.\n\n3. To determine compliance with laws and regu-\nlations or supervisory requirements.\n\n4. To evaluate the accuracy of periodic asset\nmaintenance reports submitted to the appro-\npriate regulators.\n\n5. To evaluate specific books and records that\nmay be required for the continual monitoring\nof asset maintenance.\n\n6. To determine whether the internal audit func-\ntion adequately reviews asset maintenance\ncompilation, review, and reporting.\n\n7. To recommend corrective action when poli-\ncies, practices, procedures, or internal con-\ntrols are deficient or when violations of laws\nor regulations have been noted.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nAsset Maintenance\nExamination Procedures\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5020.3\n\nThe following procedures will determine if the\nbranch under examination has established satis-\nfactory periodic reporting, operating standards,\nand audit procedures regarding asset mainte-\nnance. Examiner discretion is required in apply-\ning these procedures.\n\n1. Review applicable statutes, regulations,\nand/or supervisory requirements for asset\nmaintenance.\n\n2. Test compliance with policies, practices,\nprocedures, and internal controls for appro-\npriate asset maintenance monitoring.\n\n3. Obtain the most recent asset maintenance\nreport filed with the regulators and deter-\nmine its accuracy. If necessary, review pre-\nvious submissions to determine any trends\nin reporting errors.\n\n4. Verify that eligible assets, as included in the\nfiled reports, are correct. Ensure that, in\naddition to credits, categories such as due\nfrom related parties, securities, fixed assets,\nand other assets have been appropriately\nadjusted.\n\n5. Test check the asset maintenance computa-\ntion for accuracy with statutory and super-\nvisory requirements. Ensure that liabilities\nrequiring cover have been appropriately\nadjusted.\n\n6. Review assets considered ineligible by the\nbranch for appropriateness and compliance\nwith laws, regulations, and supervisory\nrequirements.\n\n7. Determine that assets purchased by the\nbranch are properly reflected at fair market\nvalue. While fair market value may be\ndifficult to determine, it should, at a mini-\nmum, reflect both the rate of return being\nearned on such assets and an appropriate\nrisk premium. Determine that appropriate\nwrite-offs are taken on any assets sold by\nthe branch at less than book value.\n\n8. Review credits acquired from another lend-\ning institution as a result of a purchase,\nparticipation, or asset swap since the previ-\nous examination, to determine that the\n\nbranch has appropriate agreements evidenc-\ning the acquisition and credit documentation.\n\n9. Review credit classifications for appropriate\ninclusion in asset maintenance reports.\n\n10. Review credits that have been classified\nand/or are considered as problems by man-\nagement. If credits have been internally\nclassified, test whether they and their asso-\nciated accrued interest receivable have been\nappropriately removed from eligible assets.\n\n11. Determine whether any of the loans trans-\nferred were nonperforming at the time of\ntransfer, classified at the previous examina-\ntion, or, for any other reason, were consid-\nered to be of questionable quality.\n\n12. Scan the delinquency lists submitted to the\nhead office to determine that reports are\nsufficiently detailed to evaluate risk factors\nthat could possibly identify credits that\nmight be considered Ineligible By Examiner.\n\n13. Compile a listing of all loans not supported\nby current and satisfactory credit informa-\ntion, collateral documentation, and evi-\ndences of indebtedness.\n\n14. Ascertain whether loans are purchased on a\nrecourse basis and are sold on a nonrecourse\nbasis.\n\n15. Verify that asset maintenance monitoring\nand reports filed with appropriate regulators\nare reviewed for compliance by branch\nmanagement and that internal controls are\nadequate.\n\n16. Organize and prepare a listing of violations\nof asset maintenance laws, regulations, and\nsupervisory requirements.\n\n17. Prepare the following examination report\npages:\n• Ineligible Assets\n• Asset Maintenance and Pledge Schedule\n\n18. Prepare comments for the Compliance and\nViolation of Laws and Regulations pages, if\nnecessary.\n\n19. Prepare a complete set of workpapers to\nsupport conclusions and examination report\npages and discuss all material findings with\nmanagement.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nAsset Pledge and Capital Equivalency Deposits\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5030.1\n\nAsset pledge or capital equivalency deposit\naccounts may be established as a requirement\nfor licensing a branch. These accounts are\ndesigned to provide a ready source of liquid\nassets to begin to pay for the expenses of a\nliquidation, in the event it became necessary to\ntake possession of a branch.\n\nFederal and state licensing authorities may\nprescribe, by statute or regulation, requirements\nand conditions under which the branch will\nestablish, maintain, and conduct an asset pledge\nor capital equivalency deposit account. These\nconditions and requirements will vary from one\nregulatory agency to another. However, the fol-\nlowing represents some of the conditions or\nrequirements that may be imposed:\n\n• Balance in the account may be a specific\ndollar amount and/or a variable amount based\non a specified percentage of third party liabili-\nties (i.e., related party liabilities and other\nspecific liabilities are usually excluded);\n\n• Guidelines for establishing the account (i.e.,\naccount must be held by a third party, in the\nname of the licensing authority);\n\n• Types of assets available for pledging or\ndeposit (i.e., certificates of deposit, U.S. gov-\nernment securities, etc.);\n\n• Conducting transactions (i.e., regulatory\napproval for deposits and withdrawals and\ndirect confirmation to the licensing authority\nmay be required).\n\nAsset pledge or capital equivalency deposit\naccounts, in severe problem situations, can also\nbe used as a form of supervisory follow-up\naction. When severe problem situations are\nencountered, the licensing authority may require\nan upward adjustment by the branch in the\nbalance of the applicable account. This may be\ndone by increasing the, normally required, spe-\ncific dollar amount and/or the variable amount,\nbased on a specified percentage of third party\nliabilities. The amount of the increase should be\nsufficient to give the regulators additional funds\nto cover expenses associated with a branch\nliquidation.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nSuspicious Activities\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5040.1\n\nCurrent information on this topic is available in\nthe Federal Reserve Board’s Bank Secrecy Act\n\nManual and similar examination material of the\nother federal and state banking agencies.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nInternational Banking Facilities\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5050.1\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem amended Regulations D and Q effective\nDecember 3, 1981, to permit U.S. depository\ninstitutions, Edge and Agreement Corporations\nand U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs to\nestablish International Banking Facilities (IBFs)\nin the United States.\n\nThe Board’s objective was to enhance the\ninternational competitive position of banking\ninstitutions in the United States by permitting,\nthrough an institution’s IBF, similar deposit\nreserve and tax treatment afforded to offshore\nbanking offices. As a result, an IBF was permit-\nted to maintain a lower rate of reserves on IBF\nliabilities maintained in excess of IBF assets.\nWhen adjustments to the deposit reserve require-\nments were made in September 1990, an IBF’s\nrelative advantage with respect to deposit\nreserves was effectively eliminated. However, in\nsome states, there still remain tax advantages to\nmaintaining IBFs. Furthermore, many FBOs\ncontinue to use their IBFs as funding vehicles on\nthe assumption that former reserve requirements\nmay be reestablished.\n\nExaminations of IBFs are ordinarily con-\nducted in conjunction with examinations of the\nbranches operating those facilities, and follow\nthe same supervisory procedures.\n\nWhile a branch is not required to establish a\nseparate organization for IBF operations, it is\nrequired to segregate on its books, the asset and\nliability accounts included in the IBF.\n\nIn general, IBFs may accept deposits from\nand extend credit to non-U.S. residents or other\nIBFs. The Board’s rules impose various restric-\ntions and limitations on the type of business in\nwhich an IBF can engage. These restrictions\nwere designed to avoid complicating the con-\nduct of domestic monetary policy and insulate\nU.S. economic activity from IBF transactions.\nAs outlined in Regulation D, Section 204.8,\nthese restrictions include:\n\n• Prohibiting the lending to or accepting of\ndeposits from a U.S. resident, other than the\nbranch establishing the IBF or other IBFs;\n\n• Prohibiting the acceptance of transaction\naccounts;\n\n• Prohibiting the issuance of negotiable or bearer\ninstruments;\n\n• Requiring nonbank deposits to carry a mini-\nmum maturity or required notice period of two\nbusiness days; bank deposits can be made\nwith overnight maturities;\n\n• Subjecting nonbank customer transactions to a\nminimum deposit or withdrawal amount of\n$100,000, except to close out an account or\nwithdraw accumulated interest;\n\n• Requiring the IBF to notify its nonbank cus-\ntomers, in writing, at the time an account\nrelationship is first established that the depos-\nits received by the IBF may be used only to\nsupport its non-U.S. operations, and exten-\nsions of credit by the IBF may be used only to\nfinance the customers’ non-U.S. operations. In\nthe case of customers that are foreign affiliates\nof U.S. residents, the IBF is required to obtain\nacknowledgment of the receipt of such notice.\n\nBranches may book off-balance-sheet items\nin the IBF, provided the customer and the\ntransactions comply with applicable regulations.\nGenerally, off-balance-sheet items are booked at\nan IBF to take advantage of favorable tax rates\nor to hedge IBF assets and liabilities. Examiners\nshould review the reasons for booking such\nitems in the IBF and determine the appropriate-\nness of such action.\n\nIn addition, certain states impose further\nrestrictions and requirements governing the\nestablishment and maintenance of IBFs. The\nexaminer should review these restrictions and\nrequirements prior to establishing the scope of\nthe review.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nInternational Banking Facilities\nExamination Objectives\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5050.2\n\n1. To determine if policies, practices, proce-\ndures, and internal controls regarding IBFs\nare adequate.\n\n2. To determine if branch officers are operating\nin conformance with the established\nguidelines.\n\n3. To determine the scope and adequacy of the\naudit function.\n\n4. To determine compliance with laws and\nregulations.\n\n5.

Complete or update the Internal Control\nQuestionnaire if selected for implementation.\n\n2. Review applicable statutes, regulations,\nand/or supervisory requirements for asset\nmaintenance.\n\n3. Review IBF ledgers to determine that IBF\naccounts are clearly segregated from the\nestablishing entity’s books. (Note: IBF led-\ngers may be integrated with the establishing\nentity’s general ledger or may be main-\ntained as a separate general ledger. If the\nledgers are included with the establishing\nentity’s regular accounts, the IBF accounts\nmust be clearly labeled. IBF assets need not\nbalance with IBF liabilities.)\n\n4. Determine the adequacy of the internal\naudit procedures used to check compliance\nwith applicable regulations. Obtain a list of\nany deficiencies noted in the latest review\nperformed by the internal auditors and deter-\nmine if corrections have been made.\n\n5. In addition to verifying application of the\nbranch’s standard review, analysis, and/or\ndocumentation of IBF-booked credits and\ndeposits, evaluate the adequacy of proce-\ndures by reviewing a sample of accounts to\nensure that:\na. All deposits, extensions of credit, and\n\noff-balance-sheet items are extended to\nor accepted from qualified customers,\ni.e., foreign residents, other IBFs, and\noffices of the branch establishing the\nIBF.\n\nb. Nonbank extensions of credit are used\nonly to finance the non-U.S. operations\nof the customer.\n\nc. Nonbank deposits are used only to sup-\nport the non-U.S. operations of the\ncustomer.\n\nd. Nonbank customers are provided written\nnotice of the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors’ policy statement at the time\nthe deposit or credit relationship is first\nestablished advising of the requirement\nregarding the non-U.S. use of deposits\nand credit extensions.\n\ne. In the case of loans to or deposits from\nforeign affiliates of U.S. corporations,\n\nverify that written confirmation is\nobtained acknowledging receipt of the\nBoard of Governors’ policy. (Note: IBF\ntransactions with foreign governments\nand official institutions are treated in the\nsame manner as IBF transactions with\nforeign banks, i.e. written notice of the\nnon-U.S. use of funds is not necessary.)\n\nf. Nonbank deposits meet the minimum\nmaturity or required notice period for\nwithdrawal of two business days.\n\ng. Nonbank time deposits and withdrawals\n(except for account closings and with-\ndrawals of accumulated interest) meet\nthe minimum size transaction amount of\n$100,000.\n\nh. Deposit confirmations state that funds\nare being placed in an IBF and that the\ndepositor must abide by IBF restrictions\nas defined by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System.\n\n6. Review all intrabank transactions for an\nappropriate time period to determine that:\na. All transactions with the U.S. offices of\n\nthe IBF’s own branch are clearly\nidentifiable.\n\nb. Eurocurrency liabilities are properly\nreported by the IBF’s establishing branch.\n\n7. Review IBF purchases from and sales to\nthird parties to determine that:\na. Such assets are IBF eligible assets, and\n\nappropriate notices and acknowledg-\nments have been provided and uses of\nproceeds documented.\n\nb. The transactions are at arms length, with-\nout recourse.\n\nc. The transactions are not conducted with\naffiliates, other than the branch establish-\ning the IBF.\n\n8. Review all IBF-related regulatory reports,\ne.g., the FFIEC-002 and FR 2951, if appli-\ncable, to determine their timely submission\nand accuracy.\n\n9. Discuss apparent violations and procedural\ndeficiencies with appropriate officer(s).\n\n10. Prepare comments in appropriate report form\nfor all violations and deficiencies noted.\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nInternational Banking Facilities\nInternal Control Questionnaire\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5050.4\n\nDEPOSITS\n\n1.

Data collected\nfrom regulatory reports facilitate early identifi-\ncation of problem situations. The Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement\nAct of 1989 (FIRREA) and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991\n(FDICIA) amended various banking statutes to\nenhance the Federal Reserve’s authority to assess\ncivil money penalties against state member\nbanks, bank holding companies and FBOs that\nfile late, false, or misleading regulatory reports.\nThe civil money penalties also can be assessed\nagainst individuals who cause or participate in\nsuch filings including those who sign officially\nsubmitted reports.\n\nFILING\n\nThe Federal Reserve has identified a late regu-\nlatory report as an official copy of a report that\nis not received by the Reserve Bank or its\ndesignated electronic collection agent in a timely\nmanner. The filing of a completed original\nreport is timely in the following cases:\n\n• The report is received by the Reserve Bank at\nthe end of the reporting day on the submission\ndeadline, including reports filed electronically;\n\n• The report is mailed first class and is post-\nmarked no later than the third calendar day\npreceding the submission deadline, no matter\nwhen the report is received by the district\nFederal Reserve Bank. In the absence of a\npostmark, an institution may be called upon to\nprovide proof of timely mailing, if the report\nhas been received after the submission dead-\nline; or\n\n• The completed original report is delivered to\nan overnight package delivery service on the\nday before the submission deadline. An insti-\ntution may be called upon to provide proof of\ntimely delivery to the service, if the report has\nbeen received after the submission deadline.\n\nThe filing of a false report generally involves\nthe submission of mathematically incorrect data,\nsuch as addition errors or transpositions, the\nsubmission of call reports without appropriate\nschedules, or the inadvertent filing of inaccurate\ninformation. Conversely, the filing of a mislead-\n\ning report involves some degree of knowing or\nreckless behavior on the part of the filer and the\nintentional or negligent submission of inaccu-\nrate information to the Federal Reserve.\n\nFEDERAL RESERVE\nREGULATORY REPORTS\nMONITORING SYSTEM\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has a Regulatory\nReports Monitoring Program (program) to iden-\ntify those banking institutions under its supervi-\nsion that file late and false reports. Each Reserve\nBank maintains records of late and false report-\ners and submits summary reports of these records\nto Board staff after every reporting period.\n\nTo promote consistent treatment under the\nprogram, the Reserve Banks may not grant grace\nperiods or extensions of the submission dates of\nregulatory reports. In addition, the program\nrequires Board staff responsible for enforcement\nactions to consult with Reserve Bank staff to\nensure that appropriate follow-up supervisory\nactions are taken, and that the Federal Reserve\naddresses all instances of chronic late and false\nregulatory reporting through civil money penal-\nties or other enforcement proceedings.\n\nREVIEW OF REGULATORY\nREPORTS\n\nReview of regulatory reports involves determin-\ning whether the management of the branch has\nsubmitted all required reports to the Federal\nReserve in a timely and accurate manner. The\nexaminer assigned to a specific department in\nthe branch is responsible for reviewing those\nreports relating to that department and verifying\nthat the reports are accurate, meet statutory and\nregulatory requirements, and agree with the\nbranch’s financial records. The examiner-in-\ncharge is to consolidate the findings of the\nexamination team and submit a list of regulatory\nreporting errors to the appropriate Reserve Bank\nstaff, who will determine the extent to which the\nbranch will be required to file amended reports.\n\nExaminers should discuss with Reserve Bank\nstaff any regulatory report that is considered\nmisleading as such a report could lead to the\nissuance of suspicious activities report(s) against\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nthe involved branch and/or individual(s). In\naddition, management should be reminded that\ncivil money penalties may be assessed or other\nenforcement proceedings may be initiated against\nregulatory report filers who are chronically late\nor repeatedly file seriously inaccurate reports.\n\nBranches should maintain efficient internal\nsystems and procedures to ensure that reporting\nis made in accordance with the appropriate\nregulatory requirements. They should develop\nclear, concise, and orderly workpapers to sup-\nport the compilation of data. Preparation of\nproper workpapers not only provides a logical\ntie between report data and the branch’s finan-\ncial records but also facilitates accurate report-\ning and verification.\n\nA branch’s internal control program for regu-\nlatory reports should ensure that all required\nreports are submitted on time and are accurate.\nThe specific internal controls employed by a\nbranch to meet those objectives depend largely\non the volume of reports, the scope of a branch’s\noperations, and the complexity of its accounting\nsystem.\n\nREQUIRED REGULATORY\nREPORTS\n\nThis section describes the regulatory reports\nrequired to be submitted by the branch to the\nFederal Reserve. In addition to the list of reports\noutlined below, the examiner should also review\nthe reports that monitor compliance with asset\nmaintenance requirements, which are applicable\nunder state law or are required for federally-\nlicensed or -insured branches. For additional\ninformation on state requirements, refer to the\nSummary of Key State Statutes in the appendix\nof this manual.\n\nReport of Assets and Liabilities of\nU.S. Branches \u0026 Agencies of Foreign\nBanks (FFIEC 002 and 002S)\n\nAll branches are required to file a report of\nassets and liabilities (known as the call report),\nas of the last day of each calendar quarter.\nDetails of the appropriate reporting guidelines,\nalong with the specific report form to be filed,\nare found in the Instructions for Preparation\nof the Report of Assets and Liabilities of\n\nU.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks\n(FFIEC 002).\n\nThe branch should submit the completed call\nreports to the appropriate supervisory agencies\nno more than 30 calendar days after the report\ndate. The Federal Reserve acts as the collecting\nand processing agent of the call report for the\nfederal supervisory authorities.\n\nThe examiner should carefully review the\nreport to ensure that all pertinent data has been\nreported and is properly categorized in accor-\ndance with the call report instructions. To review\na particular branch’s call report, the examiner\nmust first understand the branch’s accounting\nmethods and the information located in, and the\nrelationships between, the branch’s general led-\nger and subsidiary ledgers. Workpapers used in\nthe preparation of the report and supplementary\nschedules will aid the examiner in understand-\ning the branch’s system.\n\nOther Regulatory Reports\n\nOther regulatory reports include the following:\n\n1.

For example, branches\nare required to file reports associated with lost\nand stolen securities, transfer agent activities,\nmunicipal securities dealer activities, govern-\nment securities broker and dealer activities,\ncriminal referrals, and BSA reporting. Specific\ncomments relating to these activities are dis-\ncussed under in the Other Compliance Matters\nsection of this manual.

Based on the information gathered, evaluate\nthe internal controls of this area (i.e. strong,\nsatisfactory, fair, marginal, unsatisfactory).\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nOther Compliance Matters\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5070.1\n\nFBOs are subject to various other federal and\nstate laws and regulations not discussed else-\nwhere in this manual. Similar to domestic bank-\ning organizations, FBOs operating in the United\nStates are required to be knowledgeable of these\nlaws and regulations and to establish policies,\npractices, procedures, and internal controls to\nensure compliance.\n\nThe following discussion is divided into two\nsections: Safety and Soundness Rules and Regu-\nlations and Consumer Compliance Regulations.\nState-licensed branches should refer to their\nstate statutory codes for specific statutes that\nmay apply. Additionally, federally-insured\nbranches are subject to the wide variety of laws\nand regulations applicable to all federally-\ninsured depository institutions.\n\nOn January 17, 1978, the three federal bank\nsupervisory agencies issued a joint policy state-\nment to address their concern regarding the\npotential for improper payments by banks and\nbank holding companies in violation of the\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act and the Federal\nElection Campaign Act. While not widespread,\nthe federal bank supervisory agencies were con-\ncerned that such practices could reflect adversely\non the banking system and constitute unsafe and\nunsound banking practices, in addition to their\npossible illegality.\n\nThe potential devices for making political\npayments in violation of the law could include\ncompensatory bonuses to employees, designated\nexpense accounts, fees or salaries paid to offi-\ncers, and preferential or zero interest rate loans.\nIn addition, political contributions could be\nmade by providing equipment and services with-\nout charge to candidates for office.\n\nSAFETY AND SOUNDNESS\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\n\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act—\n15 USC 78DD-1, 78DD-2\n\nBeginning in 1973, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) became aware of conduct by\nsome companies involving the use of corporate\nfunds for illegal domestic political contribu-\ntions. Subsequent SEC investigations, revealed\ninstances in which some of the largest U.S.\ncorporations had secretly engaged in the bribery\nof foreign officials. In the course of these\n\ninvestigations, it became apparent that, in many\ninstances, these activities were concealed from\nthe outside auditors and others by maintaining\noff-the-book bank accounts or otherwise circum-\nventing the system of internal accounting\ncontrols.\n\nAs a result of these investigations, Congress\npassed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of\n1977 (Act). This Act consists of two separate\ngroups of rules: (a) those that prohibit the\noffering or payment of bribes to certain foreign\nofficials, and (b) those requiring the mainte-\nnance of complete accounting books and records\nand an effective system of accounting controls.\n\nSection 78DD-1 applies to any issuer of\nsecurities registered on a U.S. national securities\nexchange. Thus, if an FBO has issued securities\nso registered, the prohibition on certain corrupt\npractices applies to the FBO. Section 78DD-2,\nhowever, applies to any domestic concern, which\nis defined in subsection (h)(1)(B) to include any\ncorporation which has its principal place of\nbusiness in the United States. Generally, ques-\ntions of specific applicability of provisions of\nthis Act to U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs\nshould be referred to appropriate legal counsel.\n\nAntibribery Provisions\n\nThese provisions of the Act prohibit any U.S.\ncompany or business entity (and its officers,\ndirectors, agents, employees, and shareholders\nacting on its behalf) from using the mails,\ntelephone, transportation, or any other instru-\nmentality of interstate or foreign commerce\ncorruptly, in furtherance of an offer, payment,\npromise to pay, authorization of the payment of\nany money, or other thing of value to:\n\n• An official of a foreign government or instru-\nmentality of a foreign government;\n\n• A foreign political party or official thereof or\na candidate for political office; or,\n\n• Any other person the payor knows of or has\nreason to know, who will pay or give the\nmoney or value to those listed above,\n\nwhere the purpose is to influence an act or\ndecision (including a decision not to act) of the\nrecipient in his official capacity or to induce the\nrecipient to use his or her influence to affect or\ninfluence an act or decision of the government\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 1\n\n\n\nor instrumentality, in order to assist such com-\npany or entity in obtaining, retaining, or direct-\ning business for itself or another person.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to payments to\nany employee whose duties are essentially min-\nisterial or clerical.\n\nAccounting Provisions\n\nAlthough the obligation to maintain accurate\nbooks and records and to have an adequate\nsystem of internal accounting controls has been\nacknowledged by responsible corporations for a\nlong time, this obligation was not previously\nexplicitly established into law until the passage\nof the Act. Applying essentially to all compa-\nnies whose securities are publicly traded in the\nUnited States, the Act requires them to:\n\n• Make and keep books, records, and accounts,\nwhich, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the issuer; and\n\n• Devise and maintain a system of internal\naccounting controls sufficient to provide rea-\nsonable assurance that:\n— Transactions are executed in accordance\n\nwith management’s general or specific\nauthorizations;\n\n— Transactions are recorded as necessary\n(1) to permit preparation of financial state-\nments in conformity with generally\naccepted accounting principles or any other\ncriteria applicable to such statements and\n(2) to maintain accountability for assets;\n\n— Access to assets is permitted only in\naccordance with management’s general or\nspecific authorization; and,\n\n— The recorded accountability for assets is\ncompared with the existing assets at rea-\nsonable intervals and appropriate action is\ntaken with respect to any difference.\n\nActing under its authority to issue regula-\ntions, the SEC issued regulations, which became\neffective on March 23, 1979, concerning falsi-\nfications of records and the making of false,\nmisleading, or incomplete statements to audi-\ntors. The first of these regulations says that no\nperson shall, directly or indirectly, falsify or\ncause to be falsified, any book, record or account\nsubject to the provisions of the law described\nabove, that is, those used for making reports\nunder the SEC laws.\n\nThe second regulation prohibits a director or\nofficer of an issuer from making or causing to be\nmade a materially false or misleading statement,\nand from omitting to state or cause another\nperson to omit a material fact necessary to make\na statement not misleading to an accountant,\nexternal or internal, in connection with an audit\nof the financial statements or preparation of\nrequired reports. Conviction of a willful viola-\ntion of these accounting provisions carries a\npossible $10,000 fine or up to five years impris-\nonment, or both.\n\nFederal Elections Campaign Act—\n2 USC 441B\n\nThe Federal Elections Campaign Act (FECA),\nenacted in 1971, was designed to curb potential\nabuses in the area of federal election financing.\nIn general, FECA regulates the making of cam-\npaign contributions and expenditures in connec-\ntion with primary and general elections to fed-\neral offices and specifically bans campaign\ncontributions by national banks. The Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency has, by regula-\ntion (12 CFR 28.101(4)), made this provision\napplicable to federal branches and agencies.1\nFECA does not specifically address the making\nof contributions and expenditures by banks or\nother corporations to advocate positions on issues\nthat are the subjects of public referenda. As\noriginally enacted, FECA required disclosure of\ncontributions received or expenditures made;\nhowever, amendments to the law in 1974 and\n1976 imposed additional limitations on contri-\nbutions and expenditures as well. The 1974\namendments also established the Federal Elec-\ntion Commission (Commission) to administer\nFECA’s provisions. The Commission is respon-\nsible for adopting rules to carry out FECA, for\nrendering advisory opinions, and for enforcing\nthe Act. The Commission was reorganized as a\nresult of the FECA Amendments of 1976 and it\nhas since issued regulations interpreting the\nstatute Title 11 of the CFR.\n\n1. 2 USC 441a, however, limits campaign contributions by\nany person. The definition of person in 2 USC 431(h) is very\nbroad and could include the U.S. branches and agencies of\nFBOs. Accordingly, any questions in this area should be\nreferred to appropriate legal counsel. In addition, 2 USC 441e\nprohibits campaign contributions by foreign nationals (the\ndefinition of which excludes U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent\nresident aliens).\n\n5070.1 Other Compliance Matters\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 2\n\n\n\nContributions and Expenditures\n\nThe words contribution and expenditure are\ndefined broadly by FECA and the Commission’s\nregulations to include any loan, advance, deposit,\npurchase, payment, distribution, subscription,\ngift of money, or anything of value that is made\nfor the purpose of influencing the nomination or\nelection of any person to federal office. The\npayment by a third party of compensation for\npersonal services rendered without charge to a\ncandidate or political committee is also treated\nas a contribution by FECA, although the term\ndoes not include the value of personal services\nprovided by an individual without compensation\non a volunteer basis.\n\nAlthough loans are included in the definitions\nof contribution and expenditure under FECA, a\nspecific exemption is provided for bank loans\nmade in the ordinary course of business and in\naccordance with applicable banking laws and\nregulations. The Commission’s regulations pro-\nvide further that extensions of credit to a candi-\ndate, political committee, or other person in\nconnection with a federal election may be treated\nas a loan, and not a contribution, if they are on\nterms substantially similar, in risk and amount,\nto those made to nonpolitical debtors. The\nregulations also provide that a debt may be\nforgiven only if the creditor has treated it in a\ncommercially reasonable manner, including mak-\ning efforts to collect the debt, which are similar\nto the efforts it would make with a nonpolitical\ndebtor. In considering whether a particular trans-\naction is a contribution or a loan, it is expected\nthat a factor would be the extent to which the\ncreditor may have departed from its customary\ncredit risk analysis.\n\nFECA and the implementing regulation per-\nmit certain limited payments to candidates or\ntheir political committees. For example, pay-\nment of compensation to a regular employee,\nwho is providing a candidate or political com-\nmittee with legal or accounting services, which\nare solely for the purpose of compliance with\nthe provisions of the FECA, is exempt from the\ndefinitions of contribution and expenditure. The\nCommission’s regulations also permit occa-\nsional use of a corporation’s facilities by its\nshareholders and employees for volunteer politi-\ncal activity; however, reimbursement to the\ncorporation is required for the normal rental\ncharge for anything more than occasional or\nincidental use.\n\nSeparate Segregated Funds and Political\nCommittees\n\nFECA allows the establishment and administra-\ntion by corporations of separate segregated funds\nto be utilized for political purposes (2 USC\nSection 441b(b)(4)). While corporate monies\nmay not be used to make political contributions\nor expenditures, corporations may bear the costs\nof establishing and administering these separate\nsegregated funds, including payment of rent for\noffice space, utilities, supplies, and salaries.\nThese costs need not be disclosed under FECA.\nCommission regulations also permit a corpora-\ntion to exercise control over its separate segre-\ngated fund.\n\nIn practice, most corporate segregated funds\nare administered by a group of corporate per-\nsonnel, which, if the fund receives any contri-\nbutions or makes any expenditures during a\ncalendar year, constitutes a political committee,\nas defined by FECA. As such, it is required to\nfile a statement of organization with the Com-\nmission, to keep detailed records of contribu-\ntions and expenditures, and to file with the\nCommission reports identifying contributions in\nexcess of $200 and candidates who are recipi-\nents of contributions from the fund.\n\nSolicitation of contributions to corporate seg-\nregated funds by political committees must be\naccomplished within the precise limits estab-\nlished by FECA. All solicitations directed to\ncorporate employees must satisfy the following\nrequirements: (1) the contribution must be\nentirely voluntary, (2) the employee must be\ninformed of the political purposes of the fund at\nthe time of the solicitation, and (3) the employee\nmust be informed of his or her right to refuse to\ncontribute without reprisal. Beyond those basic\nrequirements, FECA distinguishes between\nexecutive and administrative personnel and other\nemployees. The former and their families may\nbe solicited any number of times, while the latter\nand their families may only be solicited through\na maximum of two written solicitations per year,\nand these solicitations must be addressed to the\nemployees at their homes. Solicitations may\nalso be directed to corporate stockholders and\ntheir families in the same manner as to executive\nand administrative personnel.\n\nAlthough a corporation or a corporation and\nits subsidiaries may form several political com-\nmittees, for purposes of determining the statu-\ntory limitations on contributions and expendi-\ntures, all committees established by a corporation\n\nOther Compliance Matters 5070.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 3\n\n\n\nand its subsidiaries are treated as one. Thus, the\ntotal amount that all political committees of a\ncorporation and its subsidiaries may make to a\nsingle candidate is $5,000 in any federal election\n(provided that the committees are qualified multi-\ncandidate committees under FECA).\n\nViolation of FECA by any corporation is\npunishable by a fine of not more than $25,000,\nand any director or officer of any corporation\nwho consents to any contribution or expenditure\nby the corporation in violation of FECA is\nsubject to fine or imprisonment or both.\n\nState laws concerning this matter should also\nbe reviewed by the examiner. However, FECA\npreempts state law with respect to election to\nfederal office.\n\nBank Bribery Act—18 USC 215\n\nThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984\namended the federal bank bribery law to pro-\nhibit employees, officers, directors, agents, and\nattorneys of financial institutions from seeking\nor accepting anything of value in connection\nwith any transaction or business of their finan-\ncial institution. The definition of a financial\ninstitution in 18 USC 20(9) includes a U.S.\nbranch or agency of an FBO. The amended law\nalso prohibited anyone from offering or giving\nanything of value to employees, officers, direc-\ntors, agents, or attorneys of financial institutions\nfor or in connection with any transaction or\nbusiness of the financial institution. Because of\nits broad scope, the 1984 Act raised concerns\nthat it might have made unlawful what had\npreviously been considered acceptable conduct.\n\nIn July 1985, the Department of Justice issued\na Policy Concerning Prosecution Under the New\nBank Bribery Statute. In that policy, the Justice\nDepartment discussed the basic elements of the\nprohibited conduct under Section 215, and indi-\ncated that cases to be considered for prosecution\nunder the new bribery law entail breaches of\nfiduciary duty or dishonest efforts to undermine\nfinancial institution transactions. Because the\nstatute was intended to reach acts of corruption\nin the banking industry, the Justice Department\nexpressed its intent not to prosecute insignificant\ngift giving or entertaining that does not involve\na breach of fiduciary duty or dishonesty.\n\nCongress decided that the broad scope of the\nstatute provided too much prosecutorial discre-\ntion. Consequently, Congress adopted the Bank\n\nBribery Amendments Act of 1985 to narrow the\nscope of 18 USC 215 by adding a new element,\nnamely, an intent to corruptly influence or reward\nan officer in connection with financial institution\nbusiness.\n\nThis law now specifically excepts the pay-\nment of bona fide salary, wages, fees or other\ncompensation paid, or expenses paid or reim-\nbursed in the usual course of business. In\naddition, the law now requires the financial\ninstitution regulatory agencies to publish guide-\nlines to assist employees, officers, directors,\nagents, and attorneys of financial institutions in\ncomplying with the law. The branch’s internal\ncode or written policy should prohibit such\npersons from (1) soliciting for themselves or for\na third party (other than the branch itself)\nanything of value from anyone in return for any\nbusiness, service, or confidential information of\nthe branch and from (2) accepting anything of\nvalue (other than bona fide salary, wages, and\nfees) from anyone in connection with the busi-\nness of the branch, either before or after a\ntransaction is discussed or consummated. In\naddition, the code/policy may specify appropri-\nate exceptions to the general prohibition of\naccepting something of value in connection with\nbranch business.\n\nFurthermore, the branch’s code of conduct or\nwritten policy should provide that if a branch\nofficial is offered or receives something of value\nbeyond what is permitted in the policy, that\nbranch official must disclose that incident to an\nappropriately designated official of the financial\ninstitution. The branch should maintain such\ndisclosures. A branch official’s full disclosure\nevidences good faith when it is made in the\ncontext of properly exercised supervision and\ncontrol. Management should review the disclo-\nsures and determine that what is accepted is\nreasonable and does not pose a threat to the\nintegrity of the branch. Thus, the prohibitions of\nthe bank bribery statute cannot be avoided by\nsimply reporting to management the acceptance\nof various gifts.\n\nThe business luncheon or holiday season gift\nfrom a customer generally is not a violation of\nthe statute if: (1) its acceptance is based on a\nfamily or personal relationship existing indepen-\ndent of any business of the financial institution,\n(2) the benefit is available to the general public\nunder the same conditions on which it is avail-\nable to the branch, or (3) the benefit would be\npaid for by the branch as a reasonable business\nexpense if not paid for by another party. What is\n\n5070.1 Other Compliance Matters\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 4\n\n\n\nreasonable in one part of the country may appear\nlavish in another part. Thus, the branch may\nestablish, in its own code/policy, a range of\ndollar values, which cover the various benefits\nthat its officials may receive from those doing or\nseeking to do business with the branch.\n\nIn addition to the exceptions discussed above,\nthe branch may describe other appropriate\nexceptions to the general prohibition in its code\nof conduct or written policy, such as those that:\n\n• Permit acceptance of meals, refreshments,\ntravel arrangements, accommodations, or\nentertainment, all of reasonable value and in\nthe course of a meeting or other occasion the\npurpose of which is to hold bona fide business\ndiscussions, provided that the expenses would\nbe paid for by the branch as a reasonable\nbusiness expense, if not paid for by another\nparty;\n\n• Permit acceptance of loans from other branches\nor financial institutions on customary terms to\nfinance proper and usual activities of branch\nofficials, such as home mortgage loans, except\nwhere prohibited by law;\n\n• Permit acceptance of advertising or promo-\ntional material of reasonable value, such as\npens, pencils, note pads, key chains, calen-\ndars, and similar items;\n\n• Permit acceptance of discounts or rebates on\nmerchandise or services that do not exceed\nthose available to other customers;\n\n• Permit acceptance of gifts of reasonable value\nthat are related to commonly recognized events\nor occasions, such as a promotion, new job,\nwedding, retirement, Christmas, or bar or bat\nmitzvah;\n\n• Permit the acceptance of civic, charitable,\neducational, or religious organizational awards\nfor recognition of service and accomplishment.\n\nA serious threat to the branch’s integrity\noccurs when its officials become involved in\noutside business interests or employment that\ngive rise to a conflict of interest. Such conflicts\nof interest may evolve into corrupt transactions\nthat are covered under this Act. Accordingly, the\nbranch is encouraged to prohibit in its code/\npolicy, branch officials from self-dealing or\notherwise trading on their positions with the\nbranch or accepting a business opportunity from\nsomeone doing or seeking to do business with\nthe branch, which is not available to other\npersons or which is made available to the branch\n\nofficial because of such person’s position with\nthe branch.\n\nIf the value of the item or benefit offered or\nreceived exceeds $100, the offense is a felony\npunishable by up to thirty years imprisonment\nand a fine of up to $1,000,000 or three times the\nvalue of the bribe or gratuity, whichever is\ngreater. If value does not exceed $100, the\noffense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to\none year imprisonment and a maximum fine of\n$1,000.\n\nForeign Assets Control Regulation\n\nThe function of the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury is to promulgate and administer regu-\nlations dealing with the economic sanctions that\nthe U.S. government imposes against certain\nforeign countries, against the nationals of those\ncountries, and against the specially designated\nnationals of those countries. Under the Interna-\ntional Emergency Economic Powers Act, the\nPresident can impose sanctions such as trade\nembargoes, freezing of assets, import sur-\ncharges, etc. These sanctions usually entail the\nfreezing of a country’s assets and are politically\nmotivated. Branches must block funds transfers\nthat (1) are remitted by or on behalf of a blocked\nindividual or entity; (2) are remitted to or\nthrough a blocked entity; or (3)are remitted in\nconnection with a transaction in which a blocked\nindividual or entity has an interest. If a branch in\nthe U.S. receives instructions to make a payment\nthat falls into one of these categories, it is\nrequired to execute the payment order and place\nthe funds into a blocked account. A payment\norder cannot be canceled or amended after the\nU.S. branch has received it. Once assets or funds\nare blocked, they may be released only by\nspecific authorization from the U.S. Treasury.\n\nA ‘‘specially designated national’’ is a person\nor entity who acts on behalf of one of those\ncountries under economic sanction by the U.S.\nThe designation is done by the U.S. Secretary of\nState. Dealing with such nationals is prohibited.\nMoreover, their assets or accounts in the U.S. are\nfrozen. In certain cases, however, the Treasury\nDepartment can issue a license to a designated\nnational. This license can then be presented by\nthe customer to the institution, allowing the\ninstitution to debit his/her account. The license\ncan be either general or specific. The general\n\nOther Compliance Matters 5070.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 5\n\n\n\nlicense is not a document but a provision in the\nregulation itself authorizing certain transactions;\nthe branch must request the customer to sign an\naffidavit stating that the particular transaction is\ncovered by a general license. The specific license\nis a document (with U.S. Treasury seal, signa-\nture of OFAC’s Chief of Licensing and control\nnumber) issued by OFAC on a case-by-case\nbasis to a specific individual or company allow-\ning an activity that otherwise is prohibited by\nthe regulations; the branch must request to see\nthe original license.\n\nBlocking an account allows only credits to be\nposted to a customer’s account. If OFAC imposes\nthe blocking of an account, then the account\ncannot be used to settle claims, i.e., the branch is\nprohibited from offsetting the account; no deb-\niting is allowed. Assets can also be blocked\nwhereby the Treasury Department exercises\npowers and privileges associated with owner-\nship of all property and interests in property of\nthe sanctioned country’s government, its agen-\ncies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities in\nthe United States or within the possession or\ncontrol of U.S. persons. An institution’s corre-\nspondent banks accounts can also be blocked or\nfrozen. The branch is not allowed to tell its\ncustomer if his/her account has been blocked by\nOFAC.\n\nA 602 Request is a national emergency inquiry\nrequested by the U.S. Secretary of State. The\nU.S. government does not need an injunction\norder for this request, and the recipient of such\na request must respond to the inquiry.\n\nAny violation of the regulations implement-\ning the sanctions subjects the violator to crimi-\nnal prosecution. Criminal penalties for violating\nsanctions range up to 12 years in prison and\n$1 million in corporate fines and $250,000 in\nindividual fines, per incident. In addition, civil\npenalties of up to $250,000 per violation may be\nimposed administratively.\n\nRegulation K, International Banking\nOrganizations—12 CFR 211\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s Regulation K, Subpart B was issued\nunder the authority of the Bank Holding Com-\npany Act of 1956 (BHCA) and the International\nBanking Act of 1978 (IBA). It applies to FBOs\nwith respect to:\n\n• limitations on interstate banking;\n• exemptions from the nonbanking prohibitions\n\nof the BHCA and the IBA;\n• the approval of the establishment of an office\n\nof a foreign bank in the U.S.;\n• the termination of a foreign bank’s branch or\n\nagency;\n• the examination of an office of a foreign bank\n\nin the U.S.;\n• the disclosure of supervisory information to a\n\nforeign supervisor; and\n• the limitations on loans to one borrower by\n\nstate branches and state agencies of a foreign\nbank.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of Regula-\ntion K:\n\nSection 211.21—Definitions\n\nThis section includes all the definitions for this\nsubpart. Included in this section is the definition\nof agency and credit balances. Refer to the\nDeposit Accounts section of this manual for\nadditional information on credit balances.\n\nSection 211.22—Limitation on Interstate\nBanking\n\nThis section addresses the designation of a home\nstate for the foreign organization. The Federal\nReserve Bank District in which a foreign orga-\nnization’s home state is located, is considered\nthe organization’s ‘‘responsible Reserve Bank.’’\n\nSection 211.23—Nonbanking Activities of\nFBOs\n\nThis section exempts certain FBOs from the\nnonbanking prohibitions of the BHCA and IBA.\nAn organization must qualify for exemption\nfrom these prohibitions by meeting certain asset,\nrevenue, and net income requirements. If an\norganization does not meet the qualifications, or\nceases to be eligible for the exemption, the\norganization may apply to the Federal Reserve\nBoard for a specific determination of its eligi-\nbility. Refer to the regulation for details. If an\norganization qualifies for this exemption, it may\nengage in certain activities and investments\ncited in the regulation. Refer to the regulation\nfor a listing of such activities and investments.\n\n5070.1 Other Compliance Matters\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 6\n\n\n\nSection 211.24—Approval of Offices of\nForeign Banks; Procedures for\nApplications; Standards for Approval;\nRepresentative-Office Activities and\nStandards of Approval; Preservation of\nExisting Authority\n\nThis section addresses the application proce-\ndures and approval process for branches, agen-\ncies, representative offices, and commercial lend-\ning companies of foreign banks. The section\nalso lists the activities in which a representative\noffice may engage. In addition, this section\nrequires uninsured federal and state branches,\nuninsured state branches, all state agencies, and\nall representative offices to file a suspicious\nactivity report in accordance with the Federal\nReserve Board’s Regulation H.\n\nSection 211.25—Termination of Offices of\nForeign Banks\n\nThis section addresses the grounds under which\na foreign bank may be required to terminate the\nactivities of its representative office, commercial\nlending company subsidiary, or state branch or\nagency. The section also includes termination\nprocedures. The license of a federal branch or\nagency would be terminated by the OCC. A\nstate branch or agency license can only be\nterminated by the respective state’s banking\nauthority.\n\nSection 211.26—Examination of Offices\nand Affiliates of Foreign Banks\n\nThis section requires an annual on-site exami-\nnation of each branch, agency, or commercial\nlending company of a foreign bank by:\n\n• the Federal Reserve Board;\n\n• the FDIC, if the branch is FDIC insured;\n\n• the OCC, if the branch or agency is licensed\nby the Comptroller; or\n\n• the state supervisor, if the branch or agency is\nlicensed by the state.\n\nTo the extent possible, these examinations\nshould be coordinated with all the regulatory\nagencies; and the examination of all U.S. offices\nof the FBO should be conducted simultaneously.\n\nSection 211.27—Disclosure of Supervisory\nInformation to Foreign Supervisors\n\nAs the title suggests, this section addresses the\ndisclosure of information to a foreign banking\nregulatory or supervisory authority. Refer to the\nregulation for details.\n\nSection 211.28—Limitation on Loans to\nOne Borrower\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the\naggregate of all outstanding loans and exten-\nsions of credit at one time to a single borrower\nby all state and federal branches and agencies of\nthe same FBO are subject to the limitations and\nother provisions of section 5200 of the Revised\nStatutes (12 USC 84). Section 5200 of the\nRevised Statutes (12 USC 84) limits loans and\nextensions of credit to a person outstanding at\none time which are not fully secured, to 15% per-\ncent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired\nsurplus for the association. Separate from and in\naddition to this 15% limitation, loans and exten-\nsions of credit to a person outstanding at one\ntime which are fully secured by readily market-\nable collateral having a market value, are limited\nto 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired\nsurplus of the association. In the case of a\nbranch, the ‘‘unimpaired capital and unimpaired\nsurplus of the association’’ is the unimpaired\ncapital and unimpaired surplus of the FBO as\nreported on the FBO’s Annual Report of FBO\n(FR Y-7). Section 5200 allows for some exemp-\ntions to these limits; however, the examiner\nshould place the burden of proof upon the\nbranch to justify qualifications for these\nexemptions.\n\nRegulation D, Reserve Requirements\nof Depository Institutions—\n12 CFR 204\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s Regulation D was issued under the\nauthority of section 19 (12 USC 461) and other\nprovisions of the Federal Reserve Act and of\nsection 7 of the IBA (12 USC 3105). The\nregulation relates to the reserves that depository\ninstitutions are required to maintain. The reserve\nrequirements apply to a foreign bank’s branch or\nagency located in the U.S., in the following\ninstances:\n\nOther Compliance Matters 5070.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 7\n\n\n\n• its parent bank has total worldwide consoli-\ndated bank assets in excess of $1 billion;\n\n• its parent bank is controlled by a foreign\ncompany or group of foreign companies that\nown or control foreign banks that in the\naggregate have total worldwide consolidated\nbank assets in excess of $1 billion; or\n\n• the branch is eligible to apply to become a\nFDIC-insured bank.\n\nRefer to the regulation for information on the\ncalculation and maintenance of reserves. Sec-\ntion 5060 of this manual also addresses the\nregulatory reports required to calculate reserves.\nThe examiner assigned the review of regulatory\nreports should determine whether any violations\nof Regulation D exist.\n\nBank Secrecy Act—31 USC 5311, et\nseq. and 31 CFR Part 103, et seq./\nRegulation H, Section 208.14\n\nRefer to the Federal Reserve System’s Bank\nSecrecy Act Manual for information on these\nrules and regulations.\n\nTransfer Agent Activities\n\nIf a branch acts as a transfer agent for the stock\nof its holding company or any other equity\nsecurity, it may have to register with the Board\nof Governors as a transfer agent, pursuant to the\nrequirements of Regulation H (section 208.8(f)),\nby filing uniform interagency Form TA-1. A\ndiscussion of the responsibilities of a branch as\na transfer agent, the reports and filing require-\nments, and other information, including exami-\nnation procedures, are contained in the Board’s\nTransfer Agent Examination Manual. The Board\nhas developed a separate Report of Examination\nof Transfer Agents.\n\nMunicipal Securities Dealer Activities\n\nA branch that is a municipal securities dealer\nmust register with the SEC and with the Board\nas a municipal securities dealer, pursuant to SEC\nRule 15Ba2-1, by filing Form MSD. A discus-\nsion of the responsibilities as a municipal secu-\nrities dealer, filing requirements, and other\ninformation, including examination procedures,\n\nis contained in the Board’s Municipal Securities\nDealer Examination Manual. The Board has\ndeveloped a separate Report of Examination of\nMunicipal Securities Dealer Activities.\n\nGovernment Securities Broker and Dealer\nActivities\n\nIf a branch acts as a government securities\nbroker and/or dealer, it may have to file notice\nwith the Board as a government securities bro-\nker and/or dealer pursuant to section 15C(a)(1)(B)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, by filing\nForm FR G-FIN. A discussion of the branch’s\nresponsibilities as a government securities bro-\nker and/or dealer, filing requirements, and other\ninformation, including examination procedures\nis contained in the Board’s Procedures for the\nExamination of Government Securities Activi-\nties. The Board has developed a separate Sum-\nmary Report of Examination of Government\nSecurities Broker/Dealer or Custodial Activities.\n\nLost and Stolen Securities Reporting\nand Inquiry Requirements—\n17 CFR 240.17F-1\n\nA branch with deposits insured by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (reporting insti-\ntution) must register with the Securities and\nExchange Commission’s designee, Securities\nInformation Center, Inc. (SIC) and report lost,\nmissing, stolen, or counterfeit securities to the\nSIC. Each insured branch is responsible for\ncontacting the SIC to determine if securities\ncoming into its possession, whether by pledge,\ntransfer or some other manner, have been pre-\nviously reported as missing, lost, stolen,\nor counterfeit, except in certain limited\ncircumstances.\n\nAll functions within a branch that handle or\nprocess securities are subject to the reporting\nrequirements. Only the transfer agent function is\nexempt from the inquiry requirements. Accord-\ningly, all branch departments likely to be\naffected, including the trust, investment, transfer\nagent, custody or dealer departments, and the\nlending operations as relating to margin loans,\nshould be familiar with the requirements set out\nin 17 CFR 240.17F-1.\n\nSecurities exempt from the reporting require-\nments are:\n\n5070.1 Other Compliance Matters\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 8\n\n\n\n• Registered securities of the U.S. government\nand federal agencies thereof;\n\n• Securities that have not been assigned CUSIP\nnumbers; and,\n\n• Bond coupons.\n\nSecurities exempt from the inquiry require-\nments are:\n\n• Securities received directly from the issuer or\nits agent at issuance;\n\n• Securities received from another reporting\ninstitution or from a Federal Reserve Bank or\nbranch;\n\n• Securities received from a customer of the\nreporting institution in the name of the cus-\ntomer or nominee; and,\n\n• Securities that are a part of a transaction of\n$10,000 or less (aggregate face value for\nbonds or market value for stocks).\n\nReporting Lost, Missing, Stolen or\nCounterfeit Securities\n\nForm X-17F-1A must be filed with the SIC\nwithin one business day after the discovery of:\n\n• A theft or loss of any security, when there is a\nsubstantial indication of criminal activity;\n\n• A security that has been lost or missing for\ntwo business days; or\n\n• A security that is counterfeit.\n\nThe form must be filed within two business\ndays of notification of nonreceipt when\n(1) delivery of securities sent by the branch is\nmade by mail or by draft and payment is not\nreceived within ten business days and confirma-\ntion of nondelivery has been made by the\nreceiving institution and (2) delivery is made in\nperson and no receipt is maintained by the\nbranch. If securities sent by the branch, either in\nperson or through a clearing agency, are lost in\ntransit and the certificate numbers of the secu-\nrities can be determined, the branch must supply\nthe receiving institution with the certificate num-\nbers of the securities within two business days\nfrom the date of the request from the receiving\ninstitution. The delivery of lost or missing\nsecurities to the branch must be reported within\none business day after discovery and notification\nof certificate numbers. Securities that are con-\nsidered lost or missing as a result of counts or\nverifications must be reported no later than ten\n\nbusiness days after discovery or as soon as\ncertificate numbers can be ascertained.\n\nCopies of all reports required to be filed under\n17 CFR 240.17F-1 must also be submitted to the\nregistered transfer agent for the issue being\nreported and, if criminal activities are suspected,\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Copies of\nfiled or received Forms X-17F-1A must be\nmaintained in an easily accessible place for\nthree years.\n\nCONSUMER COMPLIANCE\nREGULATIONS\n\nSince the late 1960s, Congress has enacted a\nnumber of consumer protection and civil rights\nlaws directly related to the activities of financial\ninstitutions. Traditionally, these laws have been\nenforced by the domestic institution’s primary\nfederal regulator; for example, the Board of\nGovernors conducts consumer compliance\nexaminations for state member banks. More\nrecently, as part of the Federal Deposit Insur-\nance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,\nCongress expanded the authority of the Board\nand other federal banking agencies to enforce\nconsumer statutes for certain types of FBOs.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Reserve System is\nresponsible for enforcing consumer laws in the\ncase of state-licensed agencies and state-licensed\nuninsured branches of FBOs, commercial lend-\ning companies owned or controlled by FBOs\nand organizations operating under section 25 or\n25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (Edge Act and\nAgreement corporations). In addition, the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency is respon-\nsible for conducting these examinations for\nfederally-licensed, uninsured branches of FBOs\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nis responsible for federally-insured branches of\nFBOs.\n\nThe scope of a typical compliance examina-\ntion for these institutions includes the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the\nFair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collec-\ntion Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer\nAct, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act. The degree to\nwhich FBOs operating in the U.S. conduct\nactivities covered by these laws and regulations\nvary, but often these institutions conduct far\nfewer such activities than a typical domestically-\nchartered bank.\n\nOther Compliance Matters 5070.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 9\n\n\n\nExaminations of entities of FBOs should be\nconducted using existing regulatory policies and\nprocedures for domestically-chartered bank com-\npliance examinations. Examiner guidelines for\nconducting compliance examinations and inves-\ntigating consumer complaints are contained, for\nexample, in the Board of Governor’s Consumer\nCompliance Handbook and various supervisory\nConsumer Affairs letters. These guidelines\ndescribe the examination procedures to be used\nin connection with loan file sampling, reporting\nand correcting violations, and rating branches\nfor compliance. Of particular importance are\nviolations that require reimbursement of over-\ncharges and violations that trigger corrective\naction under the Board’s Regulation B/Fair\nHousing Act Policy Guide.\n\nFollowing is a description of some of the\nregulations and consumer protection laws that\nFederal Reserve System examiners enforce. This\ninformation is provided primarily as reference\nmaterial; examiners should consult the detailed\nhandbooks mentioned earlier for specific exami-\nnation guidance in this area.\n\nRegulation B/Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act\n\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits\ndiscrimination against an applicant for credit\nbecause of age, sex, marital status, religion,\nrace, color, national origin, or receipt of public\nassistance. It also prohibits discrimination\nbecause of a good faith exercise of any rights\nunder the federal consumer credit laws. The law\nalso contains notification requirements for con-\nsumers and small businesses that have been\ndenied credit.\n\nRegulation C/Home Mortgage\nDisclosure Act\n\nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires\ncertain lending branches to report annually on\ntheir originations and purchases of home pur-\nchase and home improvement loans and appli-\ncations for such loans. The type of loan, location\nof property, race or national origin, sex, and\nincome of the applicant or borrower are reported\nto supervisory agencies. Branches are required\nto make information regarding their lending\n\navailable to the public and must post a notice of\navailability in their public lobby.\n\nRegulation E/Electronic Funds\nTransfer Act\n\nThe Electronic Funds Transfer Act provides\nconsumer protection for all transactions using a\ndebit card or other electronic means to debit or\ncredit an account. For example, it also limits a\nconsumer’s liability for unauthorized electronic\nfund transfers, restricts issuance of debit cards,\nand requires certain disclosures.\n\nRegulation Z/Truth In Lending Act\n\nRegulation Z implements the federal Truth in\nLending Act, which is contained in Title I of the\nConsumer Protection Act and Section 1204 of\nthe Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987.\n\nThe Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure\nof certain costs and terms of credit including the\nfinance charge and the annual percentage rate so\nthat a consumer can compare the prices of credit\nfrom different sources. It also limits liability on\nlost or stolen credit cards. In addition, it pro-\nvides consumers the right to cancel certain\nhome-secured loans. Over the years, the Truth in\nLending Act has been amended by several acts.\nA summary of the provisions of each of the Acts\nfollows.\n\nConsumer Leasing Act\n\nThe Consumer Leasing Act requires disclosure\nof certain costs and terms of consumer leases, so\nthat consumers can compare the prices of leas-\ning from different sources.\n\nFair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure\nAct\n\nThe Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act\nrequires disclosures on (1) credit and charge\ncards and (2) applications and pre-approved\nsolicitations for cards, whether issued by finan-\ncial institutions, retail stores, or private compa-\nnies. Information such as APRs, annual fees,\nand grace periods must be provided in tabular\nform. The Act also requires card issuers that\n\n5070.1 Other Compliance Matters\n\nSeptember 1997 Branch and Agency Examination Manual\nPage 10\n\n\n\nimpose an annual fee to provide disclosures\nbefore annual renewal. In addition, card issuers\nthat offer credit insurance must inform custom-\ners of any increase in rate or substantial decrease\nin coverage should the issuer decide to change\ninsurance providers.\n\nFair Credit Billing Act\n\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act establishes proce-\ndures for the prompt correction of errors on\nopen-end credit accounts. It also protects a\nconsumer’s credit rating while the consumer is\nsettling any disputes.\n\nHome Equity Loan Consumer Protection\nAct\n\nThe Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection\nAct requires lenders to disclose terms, rates, and\nconditions (APR, miscellaneous charges, pay-\nment terms, and information about variable rate\nfeatures) for home equity lines of credit with the\napplications and before the first transaction under\nthe home equity plan. If the disclosed terms\nchange, the consumer can refuse to open the\nplan and is entitled to a refund of fees paid in\nconnection with the application. The Act also\nlimits the circumstances under which creditors\nmay terminate or change the terms of a home\nequity plan after it is opened.\n\nRegulation AA/Credit Practices Rule\n(issued under the Federal Trade\nCommission Act)\n\nThe Credit Practices Rule prohibits lenders from\nusing certain remedies such as confessions of\njudgement; exemption waivers; wage assign-\nments; and nonpossessory, nonpurchase money,\nsecurity interests in household goods in connec-\ntion with consumer credit contracts. The rule\nalso prohibits lenders from misrepresenting a\ncosigner’s liability and requires that lenders\n\nprovide cosigners with a notice explaining their\ncredit obligation as a cosigner. It also prohibits\nthe pyramiding of late charges.\n\nRegulation CC/Expedited Funds\nAvailability Act\n\nThe Expedited Funds Availability Act requires\nthat all banks (including branches of FBOs),\nsavings and loan associations, savings banks,\nand credit unions to make funds deposited into\nchecking, share draft, and NOW accounts avail-\nable according to specified time schedules, and\nto disclose their funds availability policies to\ntheir customers. The law does not require an\ninstitution to delay the customer’s use of depos-\nited funds but instead limits how long any delay\nmay last. The regulation also establishes rules\ndesigned to speed the return of unpaid checks.\n\nFair Credit Reporting Act\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes pro-\ncedures for correcting mistakes on a person’s\ncredit record and requires that a consumer’s\nrecord only be provided for legitimate business\nneeds. It also requires that the record be kept\nconfidential. A credit record may be retained\nseven years for judgements, liens, suits, and\nother adverse information, except for bankrupt-\ncies, which may be retained ten years. If a\nconsumer has been denied credit, a cost-free\ncredit report may be requested within 30 days of\ndenial.\n\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act\n\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is\ndesigned to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and\nunfair debt collection practices. It applies to\nthird party debt collectors or those who use a\nname other than their own in collecting con-\nsumer debts.\n\nOther Compliance Matters 5070.1\n\nBranch and Agency Examination Manual September 1997\nPage 11\n\n\n\nOther Compliance Matters\nExamination Objectives\nEffective date July 1997 Section 5070.2\n\n1.
