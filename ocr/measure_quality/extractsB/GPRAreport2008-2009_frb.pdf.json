Report\n\n2008-2009\n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\nAbout This Biennial Performance Report\n\nThe Government Performance and Results Act\n(GPRA) of 1993 requires that federal agencies, in con-\nsultation with the Congress and outside stakeholders,\nprepare a strategic plan covering a multiyear period\nand submit an annual performance plan and perfor-\nmance report. Although the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (Board) is not covered by\nGPRA, the Board of Governors voluntarily complies\nwith the spirit of GPRA and, like federal agencies, pre-\npares these regular plans and reports.\n\nConsistent with the requirements of GPRA, this Per-\nformance Report is based on two earlier Board docu-\nments covering the same period—the Government Per-\nformance and Results Act Strategic Planning Document,\n2008-2011 and the Government Performance and\nResults Act Biennial Performance Plan, 2008-2009,\nboth published in 2008.! This report covers two years\nrather than just one because the Board operates under\na biennial budget.\n\nLike the Biennial Performance Plan 2008-2009, this\nreport focuses on four areas: the Board’s monetary\npolicy function, its bank supervision and regulation\nfunction, its operations in overseeing Federal Reserve\nSystem (the System) activities, and its management\nactivities to improve effectiveness and efficiency.\nAlthough a discussion of the Federal Reserve System\nand its structure is provided below to help explain the\nperformance measures used by the Board, this perfor-\nmance report focuses solely on Board operations.\n\nAs required by GPRA, this report is issued indepen-\ndently of other Board documents submitted to the\nCongress. However, considering the report in conjunc-\ntion with other Board documents gives a more detailed\n\n1. These documents are available on the Board’s website, respec-\ntively, at www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/gpra/\ngpra2008-2011.pdf and www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/\nRptCongress/gpra/gpra2008-2009 biennial. pdf.\n\nunderstanding of Board planning, budgeting, opera-\ntions, and performance. As required by the Federal\nReserve Act, the Board annually submits a report to the\nCongress describing in detail the operations of the Sys-\ntem for the previous year. Since 1985, the Board has\nalso provided the Congress with a supplement, the\nAnnual Report: Budget Review, which describes in\ndetail the plans and resources discussed in the approved\nbudgets of the Board and the Reserve Banks. The most\nrecent versions of these two documents were provided\nto the Congress in 2010.2\n\nOverview of the Federal Reserve System\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the\nUnited States, established by the Congress to provide\nthe nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable\nmonetary and financial system. Over the years, its role\nin banking and the economy has expanded, and today\nthe Federal Reserve’s duties fall into five general areas:\n\n1. conducting the nation’s monetary policy by influ-\nencing money and credit conditions in the economy\nin pursuit of maximum employment and stable\nprices\n\n2. supervising and regulating banking institutions to\nensure the safety and soundness of the nation’s\nbanking system, maintaining the stability of the\nfinancial system, and containing systemic risk that\nmay arise in financial markets\n\n3. protecting the credit rights of consumers and\nencouraging banks to meet the credit needs of con-\nsumers, including those in low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods\n\n4. playing a major role in operating the nation’s pay-\nment systems\n\n2. Refer to the Board’s 96th Annual Report, 2009 at www\n.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual09/default.htm and\nthe Annual Report: Budget Review for 2010 at www.federalreserve.gov\n/boarddocs/rptcongress/budgetrev/br10.pdf.\n\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/gpra/gpra2008-2011.pdf\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/gpra/gpra2008-2011.pdf\nwww.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/RptCongress/gpra/gpra2008-2009biennial.pdf\nwww.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/RptCongress/gpra/gpra2008-2009biennial.pdf\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual09/default.htm\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual09/default.htm\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/budgetrev/br10.pdf\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/budgetrev/br10.pdf\n\n2 Government Performance and Results Act Biennial Performance Report [] 2008-2009\n\n \n\n5. providing certain financial services to the U.S. gov-\nernment, the public, financial institutions, and for-\neign official institutions\n\nThe System was created by passage of the Federal\nReserve Act (the act), which President Woodrow Wil-\nson signed into law on December 23, 1913. The act\nstated that the System was created “to provide for the\nestablishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an\nelastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting com-\nmercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision\nof banking in the United States, and for other pur-\nposes.”\n\nSoon after the creation of the Federal Reserve, it\nbecame clear that the act had broader implications for\nnational economic and financial policy. As time has\npassed, further legislation has clarified and supple-\nmented the System’s original purposes. Key laws affect-\ning the Federal Reserve include the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956 and its amendments; the Finan-\ncial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement\nAct of 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-\ntion Improvement Act of 1991; the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (GLBA) of 1999; and the Check Clearing for\nthe 21st Century Act of 2004. In a 1977 amendment to\nthe Federal Reserve Act, the Congress defined the pri-\nmary objectives of national economic policy. These\nobjectives include economic growth in line with the\neconomy’s potential to expand; a high level of employ-\nment; stable prices (that is, stability in the purchasing\npower of the dollar); and moderate long-term interest\nrates. Major financial services reform legislation, incor-\nporated in the GLBA, reflects changes in the nature of\nthe industry and in the economy generally. GLBA and\nthe changes it ushered in for the United States financial\nservices industry continues to affect significantly the\noperations and workload of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSince the late 1960s, several federal laws were created\nthat were designed to protect consumers when secur-\ning credit or in making other financial transactions has\ngrown. The Congress has assigned to the Federal\nReserve the duty of implementing the provisions of\nthese laws to ensure that consumers receive comprehen-\nsive information and fair treatment from financial insti-\ntutions when they engage in these transactions. Con-\nsumer protection laws such as the 1968 Truth in\nLending Act, the Community Reinvestment Act of\n1977 (CRA), the Expedited Funds Availability Act of\n1987, the Truth in Savings Act of 1991, and the Fair\nand Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 have\ngiven the Federal Reserve rule-writing, compliance, and\nconsumer education responsibilities. As a result of the\nrecent financial crisis, the federal government is consid-\n\nering additional legislation designed to update the\nfinancial regulatory system and increase consumer pro-\ntection. Although the outcome of current legislative\nefforts is still uncertain, several of the proposals could\nsignificantly impact the Board’s organization, opera-\ntions, and resource requirements.\n\nSystem Role in the Government\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is considered to be an\nindependent central bank because its decisions do not\nhave to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the\nexecutive branch of government. The System is, how-\never, subject to oversight by the U.S. Congress. The\nFederal Reserve must work within the framework of\nthe overall objectives of economic and financial policy\nestablished by the government; therefore, the descrip-\ntion of the System as “independent within the govern-\nment” is more accurate.\n\nStructure of the System\n\nCongress designed the structure of the Federal Reserve\nSystem to give it a broad perspective on the economy\nand on economic activity in all parts of the nation. It is\na federal system, composed of a central, governmental\nagency—the Board of Governors—in Washington,\nD.C., and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The\nBoard and the Reserve Banks share responsibility for\nsupervising and regulating certain financial institutions\nand activities, for providing banking services to deposi-\ntory institutions and the federal government, and for\nensuring that consumers receive adequate information\nand fair treatment in their business with the banking\nsystem.\n\nA major component of the System is the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), which is made up\nof the members of the Board of Governors, the presi-\ndent of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and\npresidents of four other Federal Reserve Banks, who\nserve on a rotating basis. The FOMC oversees open\nmarket operations, which is the main tool used by the\nFederal Reserve to influence overall monetary and\ncredit conditions.\n\nBoard of Governors\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem is a federal government agency. The Board is com-\nposed of seven members, who are appointed by the\nPresident of the United States and confirmed by the\nUSS. Senate. The full term of a Board member is 14\nyears, and the appointments are staggered so that one\n\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 3\n\n \n\nterm expires on January 31 of each even-numbered\nyear. After serving a full term, a Board member may\nnot be reappointed. If a member leaves the Board\nbefore his or her term expires, however, the person\nappointed and confirmed to serve the remainder of the\nterm may later be reappointed to a full term.\n\nThe Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board\nare also appointed by the President and confirmed by\nthe Senate. The nominees to these posts must already be\nmembers of the Board or must be simultaneously\nappointed to the Board. The terms for these positions\nare four years.\n\nMISSION, VALUES, AND GOALS\nOF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the Board is to foster the stability, integ-\nrity, and efficiency of the nation’s monetary, financial,\nand payment systems so as to promote optimal macro-\neconomic performance.\n\nValues\n\nThe following values of the Board guide its organiza-\n\ntional decisions and its employees’ actions.\n\n¢ Public interest. In its actions and policies, the Board\nseeks to promote the public interest. It is accountable\nand responsive to the general public, the U.S. govern-\nment, and the financial community.\n\n¢ Integrity. The Board adheres to the highest standards\nof integrity in its dealings with the public, the finan-\ncial community, and its employees.\n\n¢ Excellence. The conduct of monetary policy, respon-\nsibility for bank supervision, and maintenance of the\npayment system demand high-quality analysis, high\nperformance standards, and a secure, robust infra-\nstructure. The pursuit of excellence drives the\nBoard’s policies concerning recruitment, selection,\nand retention for Board employees.\n\n¢ Efficiency and effectiveness. In carrying out its func-\ntions, the Board is continually aware that its opera-\ntions are supported primarily by public funds, and it\nrecognizes its obligation to manage resources effi-\nciently and effectively.\n\n¢ Independence of views. The Board values the diversity\nof its employees; input from a variety of sources; and\nthe independent professional judgment that is fos-\ntered by the System’s highly valued regional struc-\nture. It relies on strong teamwork to mold indepen-\ndent viewpoints into coherent, effective policies.\n\nGoals\n\nThe Board has six primary goals with interrelated and\nmutually reinforcing elements:\n\n1. conducting monetary policy that promotes the\nachievement of the statutory objectives of maxi-\nmum sustainable longterm growth and the price sta-\nbility that fosters that goal\n\n2. promoting a safe, sound, competitive, and accessible\nbanking system and stable financial markets\n\n3. developing regulations, policies, and programs\ndesigned to inform and protect consumers, to\nenforce federal consumer protection laws, to\nstrengthen market competition, and to promote\naccess to banking services in historically under-\nserved markets\n\n4. providing high-quality professional oversight of the\nReserve Banks\n\n5. fostering the integrity, efficiency, and accessibility of\nU.S. payment and settlement systems\n\n6. fostering the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of\nBoard programs\n\nRole of Strategic Planning\n\nUnlike most other government agencies, the Board’s\nbudget is not subject to the Congressional appropria-\ntions process or to review by the administration\nthrough the Office of Management and Budget. Rather,\nthe Board establishes its own budget formulation pro-\ncedures, conducts strategic planning to identify changes\nto its critical activities and the proper amount and allo-\ncation of resources to support its mission, and provides\nvarious reports and budget testimony to the Congress.\nThe Board, like the framers of the Federal Reserve\nAct, considers its budgetary independence directly rel-\nevant to independence in managing monetary policy.\nThat said, the Board believes that to maintain budget-\nary independence, it must demonstrate effective and\nefficient use of its financial resources. Resource man-\nagement begins with a clear mission statement, identifi-\ncation of goals, a review of factors that might affect the\nlong-term attainment of these goals, and consideration\nof possible responses to those factors. By establishing\nobjectives to attain its goals and by identifying the\nresources needed to accomplish them, the Board devel-\nops a budget necessary to implement its strategic plan.\nStrategic planning is a critical factor in ensuring the\nlong-term effectiveness of Board operations and in\nminimizing its costs. Effectiveness is improved through\ntimely identification of threats and through efforts to\nimprove operational efficiency. Efficiency is increased\n\n\n4 Government Performance and Results Act Biennial Performance Report L] 2008-2009\n\n \n\nby early identification of issues and timely responses.\nMajor factors affecting the current strategic plan\ninclude the following:\n\n1. The desire to develop better performance metrics for\neach division and major Board function, and pro-\nvide comparative Boardwide management data to\nsenior staff\n2. Continuing advances in automation and telecom-\nmunication technologies that will\n* foster the efficiency associated with greater stan-\ndardization of System supervision and regulation\nautomation tools and databases, and help ensure\nbetter coordination of plans, strategies, actions,\nand information sharing with other domestic and\nforeign regulators;\n\n* reduce reaction time to address systemic issues;\n\n* require and make possible enhanced systems for\nidentifying, measuring, and pricing risk;\n\n* improve the capabilities for gathering, analyzing,\nand sharing data; and\n\n* provide significant opportunities for improving\ncommunication with the public\n\n3. The need for actions and policies that attract and\nretain a highly motivated, properly trained, and\nfairly compensated professional workforce\n\n4. The need for contingency plans related to the safety\nof personnel, disaster recovery, and information\n\n5. The current state of the U.S. and foreign economies\n\nAs technological and other changes evolve and accel-\nerate, planning is essential to the effective and efficient\nconduct of Board operations. A continuing challenge\nto government agencies in this regard is identifying the\nappropriate measures of performance. The Board’s\nstrategic planning effort recognizes the key distinctions\nbetween government and private-sector strategic plan-\nning efforts and measurement of those efforts. Private-\nsector planning often relies on measures of cost and\nrevenue derived from prices determined in competitive\nmarkets; the results of that planning are reflected in the\nability of the private entity to prosper over time. The\ngovernment does not have direct competition in certain\nareas, and has a monopoly in others (conducting mon-\netary policy, for example); establishing a comparable\nmetric to costs and prices is therefore extraordinarily\ndifficult. Moreover, the results are judged relative to\npublic policy objectives embodied in law, which often\nare not readily measurable. The Board seeks to accom-\nplish its mission effectively while creating the efficien-\ncies that come from strategic planning, recognizing that\nanalogies to the private sector are just that. The Board’s\ncentral planning objective is oriented toward achieving\n\neffectiveness and efficiency specific to the functions it\nserves.\n\nMONETARY POLICY FUNCTION\n\nGoal\n\nConduct monetary policy that promotes the achieve-\nment of the statutory objectives of maximum sustain-\nable long-term growth and the price stability that fos-\nters that goal.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Informed monetary policy: Staying abreast of recent\ndevelopments and prospects in the U.S. economy\nand financial markets, and in those abroad, so that\nmonetary policy decisions will be well informed\n\n2. Understanding of macroeconomics and markets:\nEnhancing our knowledge of the structural and\nbehavioral relationships in the macroeconomic and\nfinancial markets, and improving the quality of data\nused to gauge economic performance, through\ndevelopmental research activities\n\n3. Effective implementation of monetary policy: Imple-\nmenting monetary policy effectively in rapidly\nchanging economic circumstances and in an evolv-\ning financial market structure\n\n4. Contribution to international efforts: Contributing to\nthe development of U.S. international policies and\nprocedures in cooperation with the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury and other agencies\n\n5. Expanded public awareness of monetary policy: Pro-\nmoting understanding of Federal Reserve policy\namong other government policy officials and\nthe general public\n\nPerformance Measures\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board’s monetary policy in\nrelation to evolving economic and financial cir-\ncumstances continues to be reviewed by the Congress\nin the context of the Board’s semiannual monetary\npolicy report and the accompanying testimony. It is rec-\nognized that monetary policy has only a partial and\nindirect influence on performance of the U.S. economy.\n\nResources\n\nThe majority of the resources utilized to achieve this\ngoal are reported in the Board’s three research divi-\nsions, the Office of Board Members, the Office of the\n\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 5\n\n \n\nSecretary, and the Office of the Staff Director for Man-\nagement. The combined expenses for the 2008-09 bien-\nnium for these divisions and offices totaled approxi-\nmately $230 million.\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION FUNCTION\n\nGoals\n\nSafety and Soundness: Promote a safe, sound, competi-\ntive, and accessible banking system and stable financial\nmarkets\n\nConsumer Protection: Develop regulations, policies,\nand programs designed to inform and protect consum-\ners, to enforce federal consumer protection laws, to\nstrengthen market competition, and to promote access\nto banking services in historically underserved markets\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Financial stability and risk containment: Promoting\noverall financial stability, managing and containing\nsystemic risk, and identifying emerging financial\nproblems early so that crises can be averted\n\n2. Accessibility of the banking system: Providing a safe,\nsound, competitive, and accessible banking system\nthrough comprehensive and effective supervision of\nUSS. banks, bank and financial holding companies,\nforeign banking organizations, and related entities\n(at the same time, remaining sensitive to the burden\non supervised institutions)\n\n3. Financial system efficiency: Enhancing efficiency and\neffectiveness by addressing the supervision func-\ntion’s procedures, technology, resource allocation,\nand staffing issues\n\n4. Effective oversight of financial institutions: Promot-\ning the compliance by domestic and foreign bank-\ning organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve\nwith applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and\nguidelines through a comprehensive and effective\nsupervision program\n\n5. Consumer protection: Serving as a leader in, and\nhelping shape the national dialogue on, consumer\nprotection in financial services\n\n6. Relationship building: Promoting, developing, and\nstrengthening effective communications and col-\nlaborations within the Board, the Federal Reserve\nBanks, and other agencies and organizations\n\nPerformance Measures\n\nSee table below for the 11 metrics, targets, and results\nfor the two-year period.\n\nResources\n\nThe majority of the resources utilized to achieve this\ngoal are reported in the divisions of Banking Supervi-\nsion and Regulation and Consumer and Community\nAffairs, whose combined expenses for the 2008-09\nbiennium were approximately $159 million.\n\nSupervision and Regulation Function 2008-09 Performance Measures\n\n \n\nMeasure Target\n\nResults\n\n \n\nIdentify and resolve supervisory No specific target\nand financial problems in a timely\nmanner, working alone or in coop-\neration with other authorities, to\nminimize disruptions to the finan-\ncial and payment systems and the\neconomy more generally\n\n \n\nThe Federal Reserve is actively reviewing current\nprudential standards and supervisory approaches\nto incorporate the lessons learned from the recent\nfinancial crisis.
